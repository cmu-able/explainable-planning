{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling0\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling0\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 16.872396060142467 dollars in revenue; have 0.0 dollar in idle time cost; have 1.1016798465544766 dollars in overtime cost; have 0.0 dollar in appointment lead time cost; and have 0.0 dollar in switching ABP cost per day on average. It has the lowest expected idle time cost, appointment lead time cost, and switching ABP cost; and has the highest expected revenue.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling0\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the overtime cost to 0.04285497099256244 dollar in overtime cost. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would reduce the revenue to 13.62342566843131 dollars in revenue. The decrease in overtime cost is not worth the decrease in revenue.","Mission":"scheduling0","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling0\/altPolicy1.json"]}
