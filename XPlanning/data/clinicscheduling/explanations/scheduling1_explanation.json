{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling1\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling1\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 48.50150318897435 dollars in revenue; have 0.0 dollar in idle time cost; have 3.3315046971975315 dollars in overtime cost; have 0.0 dollar in appointment lead time cost; and have 0.0 dollar in switching ABP cost per day on average. It has the lowest expected switching ABP cost, appointment lead time cost, revenue, and idle time cost.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling1\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the overtime cost to 3.207091871917884 dollars in overtime cost. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would reduce the revenue to 48.37215042736092 dollars in revenue. The decrease in overtime cost is not worth the decrease in revenue.","Mission":"scheduling1","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling1\/altPolicy1.json"]}
