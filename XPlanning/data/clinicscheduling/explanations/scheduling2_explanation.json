{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling2\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling2\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 48.50150318897435 dollars in revenue (101.49849681102563 in cost); have 0.0 dollar in idle time cost (0.0 in cost); have 3.3315046971975315 dollars in overtime cost (3.3315046971975315 in cost); have 0.49999999999999994 dollar in appointment lead time cost (0.49999999999999994 in cost); and have 0.0 dollar in switching ABP cost (0.0 in cost) per day on average. It has the lowest expected switching ABP cost, and idle time cost; and has the highest expected revenue.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling2\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the overtime cost to 3.2074667368780796 dollars in overtime cost (-0.12403796031945191 in cost), and reduce the appointment lead time cost to 0.49999998652904404 dollar in appointment lead time cost (-1.3470955906313975E-8 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would reduce the revenue to 48.37254104982766 dollars in revenue (+0.12895809785992185 in cost). The decrease in overtime cost, and the decrease in appointment lead time cost are not worth the decrease in revenue.","Mission":"scheduling2","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling2\/altPolicy1.json"]}
