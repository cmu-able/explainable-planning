{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling3\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling3\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 48.50150318897435 dollars in revenue (101.49849681102563 in cost); have 0.0 dollar in idle time cost (0.0 in cost); have 3.3315046971975315 dollars in overtime cost (3.3315046971975315 in cost); have 2.4999999999999996 dollars in appointment lead time cost (2.4999999999999996 in cost); and have 0.0 dollar in switching ABP cost (0.0 in cost) per day on average. It has the lowest expected switching ABP cost, and idle time cost; and has the highest expected revenue.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling3\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the overtime cost to 3.207321323271893 dollars in overtime cost (-0.12418337392563839 in cost), and reduce the appointment lead time cost to 2.4999999478937664 dollars in appointment lead time cost (-5.2106233106030686E-8 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would reduce the revenue to 48.37239013957834 dollars in revenue (+0.12910992302202828 in cost). The decrease in overtime cost, and the decrease in appointment lead time cost are not worth the decrease in revenue.","Mission":"scheduling3","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling3\/altPolicy1.json"]}
