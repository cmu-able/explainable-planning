{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling4\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling4\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 43.719947653966884 dollars in revenue (106.28005234603314 in cost); have 11.87239408404819 dollars in idle time cost (11.87239408404819 in cost); have 1.467500495843418 dollars in overtime cost (1.467500495843418 in cost); have 0.0 dollar in appointment lead time cost (0.0 in cost); and have 0.0 dollar in switching ABP cost (0.0 in cost) per day on average. It has the lowest expected switching ABP cost, and appointment lead time cost; and has the highest expected revenue.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling4\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the idle time cost to 11.74554318834945 dollars in idle time cost (-0.12685089569874108 in cost), and reduce the overtime cost to 1.4594905032647403 dollars in overtime cost (-0.008009992578677627 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would reduce the revenue to 43.570841951315536 dollars in revenue (+0.14910570265132606 in cost). The decrease in idle time cost, and the decrease in overtime cost are not worth the decrease in revenue.","Mission":"scheduling4","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling4\/altPolicy1.json"]}
