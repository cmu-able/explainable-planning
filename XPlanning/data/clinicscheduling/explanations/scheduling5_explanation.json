{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling5\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling5\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 43.719947653966884 dollars in revenue (106.28005234603314 in cost); have 11.87239408404819 dollars in idle time cost (11.87239408404819 in cost); have 1.467500495843418 dollars in overtime cost (1.467500495843418 in cost); have 0.5246944526720487 dollar in appointment lead time cost (0.5246944526720487 in cost); and have 0.0 dollar in switching ABP cost (0.0 in cost) per day on average. It has the lowest expected switching ABP cost.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling5\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the overtime cost to 1.4653037585982283 dollars in overtime cost (-0.0021967372451896505 in cost), reduce the appointment lead time cost to 0.5217423544282429 dollar in appointment lead time cost (-0.002952098243805823 in cost), and increase the revenue to 43.85894920095676 dollars in revenue (-0.13900154698986 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the idle time cost to 12.01950664377053 dollars in idle time cost (+0.1471125597223395 in cost). The decrease in overtime cost, the decrease in appointment lead time cost, and the increase in revenue are not worth the increase in idle time cost.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling5\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the idle time cost to 11.74554318834945 dollars in idle time cost (-0.12685089569874108 in cost), and reduce the overtime cost to 1.4594905032647403 dollars in overtime cost (-0.008009992578677627 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the appointment lead time cost to 0.5263318188145291 dollar in appointment lead time cost (+0.0016373661424803343 in cost), and reduce the revenue to 43.570841951315536 dollars in revenue (+0.14910570265132606 in cost). The decrease in idle time cost, and the decrease in overtime cost are not worth the increase in appointment lead time cost, and the decrease in revenue.","Mission":"scheduling5","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling5\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling5\/altPolicy2.json"]}
