{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling6\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling6\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 43.96973011683296 dollars in revenue (106.03026988316702 in cost); have 11.941223620939365 dollars in idle time cost (11.941223620939365 in cost); have 1.7074448807976652 dollars in overtime cost (1.7074448807976652 in cost); have 2.5 dollars in appointment lead time cost (2.5 in cost); and have 0.0 dollar in switching ABP cost (0.0 in cost) per day on average. It has the lowest expected switching ABP cost, and appointment lead time cost.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling6\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the idle time cost to 11.823459221659006 dollars in idle time cost (-0.1177643992803592 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the overtime cost to 1.7150522078843864 dollars in overtime cost (+0.007607327086721183 in cost), reduce the revenue to 43.84208839335334 dollars in revenue (+0.1276417234796554 in cost), and increase the appointment lead time cost to 2.5000000000000004 dollars in appointment lead time cost (+4.440892098500626E-16 in cost). The decrease in idle time cost is not worth the increase in overtime cost, the decrease in revenue, and the increase in appointment lead time cost.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling6\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the overtime cost to 1.6688230709993892 dollars in overtime cost (-0.03862180979827601 in cost), and increase the revenue to 44.0691498648844 dollars in revenue (-0.09941974805138898 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the idle time cost to 12.080242582730342 dollars in idle time cost (+0.1390189617909776 in cost), and increase the appointment lead time cost to 2.5000000000000004 dollars in appointment lead time cost (+4.440892098500626E-16 in cost). The decrease in overtime cost, and the increase in revenue are not worth the increase in idle time cost, and the increase in appointment lead time cost.","Mission":"scheduling6","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling6\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling6\/altPolicy2.json"]}
