{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling7\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling7\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.0 dollar in revenue (0.0 in cost); have 7.430533259989626 dollars in idle time cost (7.430533259989626 in cost); have 0.6201702520809915 dollar in overtime cost (0.6201702520809915 in cost); have 0.0 dollar in appointment lead time cost (0.0 in cost); and have 0.0 dollar in switching ABP cost (0.0 in cost) per day on average. It has the lowest expected switching ABP cost, and appointment lead time cost; and has the highest expected revenue.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling7\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the idle time cost to 7.356189662356976 dollars in idle time cost (-0.07434359763264986 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the switching ABP cost to 0.37826706780789765 dollar in switching ABP cost (+0.37826706780789765 in cost), and increase the overtime cost to 0.6619179338598223 dollar in overtime cost (+0.041747681778830814 in cost). The decrease in idle time cost is not worth the increase in switching ABP cost, and the increase in overtime cost.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling7\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the overtime cost to 0.40388451821496074 dollar in overtime cost (-0.21628573386603078 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the idle time cost to 7.861580618410395 dollars in idle time cost (+0.431047358420769 in cost). The decrease in overtime cost is not worth the increase in idle time cost.","Mission":"scheduling7","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling7\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling7\/altPolicy2.json"]}
