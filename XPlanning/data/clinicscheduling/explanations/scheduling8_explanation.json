{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling8\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling8\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.0 dollar in revenue (0.0 in cost); have 7.861580618410395 dollars in idle time cost (7.861580618410395 in cost); have 0.40388451821496074 dollar in overtime cost (0.40388451821496074 in cost); have 0.5639084735833452 dollar in appointment lead time cost (0.5639084735833452 in cost); and have 0.0 dollar in switching ABP cost (0.0 in cost) per day on average. It has the lowest expected switching ABP cost; and has the highest expected revenue.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling8\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the overtime cost to 0.3998404078990806 dollar in overtime cost (-0.004044110315880145 in cost), and reduce the appointment lead time cost to 0.5630756564965353 dollar in appointment lead time cost (-8.328170868098228E-4 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the idle time cost to 7.887638613196504 dollars in idle time cost (+0.026057994786109262 in cost). The decrease in overtime cost, and the decrease in appointment lead time cost are not worth the increase in idle time cost.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling8\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the idle time cost to 7.654165842079609 dollars in idle time cost (-0.2074147763307863 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the overtime cost to 0.5079585978653267 dollar in overtime cost (+0.10407407965036597 in cost), and increase the appointment lead time cost to 0.7112774766714058 dollar in appointment lead time cost (+0.14736900308806067 in cost). The decrease in idle time cost is not worth the increase in overtime cost, and the increase in appointment lead time cost.","Mission":"scheduling8","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling8\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling8\/altPolicy2.json"]}
