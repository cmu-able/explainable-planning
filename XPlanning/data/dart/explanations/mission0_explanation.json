It is expected to miss 0.5 expected target (0.25 in cost); and have 0.5 probaility of being destroyed (0.25 in cost). It has the lowest expected expected number of targets missed.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/mission0\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the expected probability of being destroyed by 0.375 (-0.1875 in cost). It would also increase the expected expected number of targets missed by 0.375 (+0.1875 in cost). The objective function is indifferent between this alternative and the solution policy.","solnPolicy.json":{"missTarget":"0.5","destroyedProbability":"0.5"},"Mission":"mission0.txt","altPolicy1.json":{"missTarget":"0.875","destroyedProbability":"0.125"},"Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/mission0\/altPolicy1.json"]}
