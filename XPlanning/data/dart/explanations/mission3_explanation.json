{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/mission3\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/mission3\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to miss 0.25 expected target (0.125 in cost); and have 0.046992481203007516 probaility of being destroyed (0.023496240601503758 in cost). It has the lowest expected expected number of targets missed.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/mission3\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the expected probability of being destroyed by 0.046992481203007516 (-0.023496240601503758 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the expected expected number of targets missed by 0.25000000000005784 (+0.12500000000002892 in cost). The decrease in expected probability of being destroyed is not worth the increase in expected expected number of targets missed.","solnPolicy.json":{"missTarget":"0.25","destroyedProbability":"0.046992481203007516"},"Mission":"mission3.txt","altPolicy1.json":{"missTarget":"0.5000000000000578","destroyedProbability":"0.0"},"Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/mission3\/altPolicy1.json"]}
