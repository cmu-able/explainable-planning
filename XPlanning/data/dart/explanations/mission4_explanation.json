{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/mission4\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/mission4\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to miss 0.3557330827067669 expected target (0.17786654135338345 in cost); and have 0.2217126462773475 probaility of being destroyed (0.11085632313867375 in cost). It has the lowest expected expected number of targets missed.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/mission4\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the expected probability of being destroyed by 0.02128794731146605 (-0.010643973655733024 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the expected expected number of targets missed by 0.0926926691732331 (+0.04634633458661655 in cost). The decrease in expected probability of being destroyed is not worth the increase in expected expected number of targets missed.","solnPolicy.json":{"missTarget":"0.3557330827067669","destroyedProbability":"0.2217126462773475"},"Mission":"mission4.txt","altPolicy1.json":{"missTarget":"0.44842575188","destroyedProbability":"0.20042469896588144"},"Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/mission4\/altPolicy1.json"]}
