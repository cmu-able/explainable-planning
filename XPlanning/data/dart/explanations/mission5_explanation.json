It is expected to miss 1.2903676013341623 expected targets (0.6451838006670811 in cost); and have 0.17913675165357001 probaility of being destroyed (0.08956837582678501 in cost).\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/mission5\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the expected expected number of targets missed by 0.02885179348757405 (-0.014425896743787026 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the expected probability of being destroyed by 0.24079230029955828 (+0.12039615014977914 in cost). The decrease in expected expected number of targets missed is not worth the increase in expected probability of being destroyed.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/mission5\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the expected probability of being destroyed by 0.021287947311912803 (-0.010643973655956401 in cost).
