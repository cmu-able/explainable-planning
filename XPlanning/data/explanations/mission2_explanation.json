It is expected to have 0.2 collision; take 44.11764705882353 minutes; and be somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps, non-intrusive 1.0 step, and very-intrusive 0.0 step. It has the lowest expected time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/mission2\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the intrusiveness to somewhat-intrusive 1.0 step, non-intrusive 4.0 steps, and very-intrusive 0.0 step. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 73.52941176470588 minutes. The decrease in intrusiveness is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/mission2\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 0.0 collision.
