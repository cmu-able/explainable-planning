{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/mission1\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/mission1\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.0 collision (0.0 in cost); take 2.857142857142857 minutes (0.014285714285714284 in cost); and be very-intrusive 0.0 step, non-intrusive 1.0 step, and somewhat-intrusive 0.0 step (0.0 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness, and collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/mission1\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 1.47058823529 minutes (-0.006932773109264285 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.2 collision (+0.008000000000000002 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission1","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/mission1\/altPolicy1.json"]}
