{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/mission2\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/mission2\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.2 collision (0.008000000000000002 in cost); take 44.11764705882353 minutes (0.2205882352941176 in cost); and be very-intrusive 0.0 step, somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps, and non-intrusive 1.0 step (0.02 in cost). It has the lowest expected time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/mission2\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.0 collision (-0.008000000000000002 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to very-intrusive 2.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 0.0 step, and non-intrusive 1.0 step (+0.040000000000007724 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/mission2\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the intrusiveness to very-intrusive 0.0 step, somewhat-intrusive 1.0 step, and non-intrusive 4.0 steps (-0.010000000000002602 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 73.52941176450855 minutes (+0.14705882352842511 in cost). The decrease in intrusiveness is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission2","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/mission2\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/mission2\/altPolicy2.json"]}
