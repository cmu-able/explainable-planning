{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission0\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission0\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.0 collision (0.0 in cost); take 152.60519296456872 minutes (1.238113684752676 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 6.0 steps, non-intrusive 8.0 steps, and very-intrusive 0.0 step (0.19999999999999998 in cost). It has the lowest expected collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission0\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 145.25964585397904 minutes (-0.0595957596392418 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.2000000000001274 collision (+0.1000000000000637 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission0\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the intrusiveness to somewhat-intrusive 5.0 steps, non-intrusive 7.0 steps, and very-intrusive 0.0 step (-0.033333333333512766 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 164.8092912199204 minutes (+0.09901406869899465 in cost), and increase the collision to 0.19999999999986626 collision (+0.09999999999993313 in cost). The decrease in intrusiveness is not worth the increase in time, and the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission0.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission0\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission0\/altPolicy2.json"]}
