{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission101\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission101\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.2 collision (0.06 in cost); take 148.55603091988206 minutes (1.2962695091085992 in cost); and be very-intrusive 0.0 step, somewhat-intrusive 7.0 steps, and non-intrusive 5.0 steps (0.9333333333333332 in cost).\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission101\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the intrusiveness to very-intrusive 0.0 step, somewhat-intrusive 6.0 steps, and non-intrusive 6.0 steps (-0.1333333333333333 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.6000000000000001 collision (+0.12000000000000002 in cost), and increase the time to 156.29415984753 minutes (+0.06752132864852145 in cost). The decrease in intrusiveness is not worth the increase in collision, and the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission101\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 0.0 collision (-0.06 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 159.8335539926024 minutes (+0.09840535727102284 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission101\/altPolicy3.json] would reduce the intrusiveness to very-intrusive 0.0 step, somewhat-intrusive 6.0 steps, and non-intrusive 6.0 steps (-0.13333333333333341 in cost), and reduce the time to 145.27105060383 minutes (-0.02866406564144608 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 1.0 collision (+0.24 in cost). The decrease in intrusiveness, and the decrease in time are not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission101.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission101\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission101\/altPolicy2.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission101\/altPolicy3.json"]}
