{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission103\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission103\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.2 collision (0.12 in cost); take 172.6489077496328 minutes (1.0505489911083123 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 1.0 step, very-intrusive 3.0 steps, and non-intrusive 8.0 steps (0.33333333333333337 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission103\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 167.99046007130852 minutes (-0.02834612493286892 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to somewhat-intrusive 3.0 steps, very-intrusive 3.0 steps, and non-intrusive 7.0 steps (+0.06666666666677579 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission103\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 0.0 collision (-0.12 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 192.67067967119124 minutes (+0.12183020771203634 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission103.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission103\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission103\/altPolicy2.json"]}
