{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission108\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission108\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.4 collision (0.2 in cost); take 148.33347870413425 minutes (1.4381417378236963 in cost); and be very-intrusive 1.0 step, non-intrusive 6.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 5.0 steps (0.26666666666666666 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission108\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.19999999999969936 collision (-0.10000000000015033 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 159.61100177699743 minutes (+0.10933928585807706 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission108\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the time to 138.86258998082764 minutes (-0.09182337316067657 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.5999999999997616 collision (+0.0999999999998808 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission108.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission108\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission108\/altPolicy2.json"]}
