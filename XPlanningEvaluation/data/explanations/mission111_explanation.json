{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission111\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission111\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.0 collision (0.4 in cost); take 143.20703808041097 minutes (2.1106487105535807 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 3.0 steps, very-intrusive 3.0 steps, and non-intrusive 8.0 steps (0.4 in cost).\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission111\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 139.83687615415997 minutes (-0.049670938100152995 in cost), and reduce the intrusiveness to somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps, very-intrusive 3.0 steps, and non-intrusive 8.0 steps (-0.033333333333333326 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 1.4 collisions (+0.15999999999999992 in cost). The decrease in time, and the decrease in intrusiveness are not worth the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission111\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 0.799999999999508 collision (-0.0800000000001968 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 153.1916178161025 minutes (+0.1471571553119042 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission111.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission111\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission111\/altPolicy2.json"]}
