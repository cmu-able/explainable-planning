{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission113\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission113\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.0 collision (0.0 in cost); take 195.0797118102451 minutes (1.1101271954655236 in cost); and be very-intrusive 2.0 steps, non-intrusive 6.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 6.0 steps (1.6 in cost). It has the lowest expected collision, and intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission113\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 186.27437888634 minutes (-0.05010792487464433 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.2 collision (+0.08000000000000002 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission113.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission113\/altPolicy1.json"]}
