{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission114\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission114\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.6000000000000001 collision (0.24000000000000005 in cost); take 135.47515008934678 minutes (1.5418789276277687 in cost); and be very-intrusive 3.0 steps, non-intrusive 4.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 6.0 steps (1.0 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission114\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 130.46223692099377 minutes (-0.05705330590306601 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.7999999999992827 collision (+0.07999999999971308 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission114\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 0.4 collision (-0.08000000000000002 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 142.55391543809 minutes (+0.08056532225762814 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission114.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission114\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission114\/altPolicy2.json"]}
