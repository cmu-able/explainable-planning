{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission120\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission120\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.4 collisions (0.13999999999999999 in cost); take 133.95171936350124 minutes (1.5584470355810127 in cost); and be very-intrusive 0.0 step, somewhat-intrusive 6.0 steps, and non-intrusive 6.0 steps (0.9999999999999999 in cost).\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission120\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 1.0 collision (-0.03999999999999998 in cost), and reduce the time to 126.21359043589 minutes (-0.09002843819760131 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to very-intrusive 0.0 step, somewhat-intrusive 7.0 steps, and non-intrusive 5.0 steps (+0.16666666666666663 in cost). The decrease in collision, and the decrease in time are not worth the increase in intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission120\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the intrusiveness to very-intrusive 0.0 step, somewhat-intrusive 5.0 steps, and non-intrusive 10.0 steps (-0.16666666666666663 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 153.08873739319995 minutes (+0.22264760138921247 in cost). The decrease in intrusiveness is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission120.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission120\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission120\/altPolicy2.json"]}
