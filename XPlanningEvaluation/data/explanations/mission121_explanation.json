{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission121\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission121\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.0 collision (0.0 in cost); take 169.79901613657478 minutes (0.8610064369870598 in cost); and be non-intrusive 6.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 5.0 steps, and very-intrusive 1.0 step (0.5333333333333333 in cost). It has the lowest expected collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission121\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 160.4280402966214 minutes (-0.047517769552683164 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.20000000000008233 collision (+0.1200000000000494 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission121\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the intrusiveness to non-intrusive 10.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 4.0 steps, and very-intrusive 1.0 step (-0.06666666666654975 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 205.91260493088257 minutes (+0.1831225711554938 in cost). The decrease in intrusiveness is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission121.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission121\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission121\/altPolicy2.json"]}
