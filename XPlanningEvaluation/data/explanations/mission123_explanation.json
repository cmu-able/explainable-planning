{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission123\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission123\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.2 collision (0.1 in cost); take 172.6489077496328 minutes (1.0505489911083123 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 1.0 step, very-intrusive 3.0 steps, and non-intrusive 8.0 steps (0.6666666666666667 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission123\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.0 collision (-0.1 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 192.67067967144305 minutes (+0.12183020771356845 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission123\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the time to 158.80278690314213 minutes (-0.0842520724610577 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.39999999999976543 collision (+0.09999999999988271 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission123.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission123\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission123\/altPolicy2.json"]}
