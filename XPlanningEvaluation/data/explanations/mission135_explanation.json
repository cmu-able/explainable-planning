{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission135\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission135\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.0 collision (0.0 in cost); take 159.8335539926903 minutes (0.4648916221267964 in cost); and be very-intrusive 0.0 step, somewhat-intrusive 7.0 steps, and non-intrusive 5.0 steps (0.2333333333333333 in cost). It has the lowest expected collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission135\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the intrusiveness to very-intrusive 0.0 step, somewhat-intrusive 6.0 steps, and non-intrusive 6.0 steps (-0.033333333333333326 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 182.51466384253 minutes (+0.06597024020507142 in cost). The decrease in intrusiveness is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission135\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the time to 148.55603091961171 minutes (-0.03280178575804965 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.1999999999994705 collision (+0.1599999999995764 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission135.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission135\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission135\/altPolicy2.json"]}
