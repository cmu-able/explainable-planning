{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission137\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission137\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.0 collision (0.0 in cost); take 218.04737565191465 minutes (0.6342122516523997 in cost); and be very-intrusive 0.0 step, somewhat-intrusive 4.0 steps, and non-intrusive 11.0 steps (0.26666666666666666 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness, and collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission137\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 195.36626580228003 minutes (-0.06597024020447484 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to very-intrusive Infinity steps, somewhat-intrusive Infinity steps, and non-intrusive Infinity steps (+0.06666666666666687 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in intrusiveness.","Mission":"mission137.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission137\/altPolicy1.json"]}
