{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission138\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission138\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.0 collision (0.3 in cost); take 138.57716744061383 minutes (1.6339293023096642 in cost); and be non-intrusive 7.0 steps, very-intrusive 5.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps (1.6999999999999997 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission138\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.7999999999982137 collision (-0.0600000000005359 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 145.65593278900565 minutes (+0.08346398140854139 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission138\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the time to 131.34246077709574 minutes (-0.08530264710601032 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 1.4000000000004686 collisions (+0.1200000000001406 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission138.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission138\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission138\/altPolicy2.json"]}
