{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission139\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission139\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.5999999999999999 collisions (0.16 in cost); take 133.0352840001666 minutes (2.023761476540243 in cost); and be non-intrusive 10.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 0.0 step, and very-intrusive 2.0 steps (0.6 in cost).\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission139\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 1.4 collisions (-0.020000000000000018 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 138.82304933129 minutes (+0.08804473640517818 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission139\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 1.19999999999868 collisions (-0.04000000000013201 in cost), and reduce the time to 128.58891077404942 minutes (-0.0676391899559865 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to non-intrusive 6.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 5.0 steps, and very-intrusive 1.0 step (+0.19999999999797802 in cost). The decrease in collision, and the decrease in time are not worth the increase in intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission139\/altPolicy3.json] would reduce the collision to 1.4 collisions (-0.020000000000000018 in cost), and reduce the intrusiveness to non-intrusive 12.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps, and very-intrusive 1.0 step (-0.10000000000000003 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 152.86788624035 minutes (+0.30169782922535493 in cost). The decrease in collision, and the decrease in intrusiveness are not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission139.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission139\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission139\/altPolicy2.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission139\/altPolicy3.json"]}
