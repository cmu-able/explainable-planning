{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission144\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission144\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.4 collision (0.16000000000000003 in cost); take 148.33347870413425 minutes (1.0786063033677722 in cost); and be very-intrusive 1.0 step, non-intrusive 6.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 5.0 steps (0.7999999999999999 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission144\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.19999999999969936 collision (-0.08000000000012028 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 159.61100177699856 minutes (+0.08200446439356579 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission144\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the time to 138.86258998073023 minutes (-0.06886752987121536 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.5999999999994856 collision (+0.07999999999979424 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission144.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission144\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission144\/altPolicy2.json"]}
