{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission146\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission146\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.2 collisions (0.24 in cost); take 131.18037600837206 minutes (1.5964353723992495 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 1.0 step, very-intrusive 3.0 steps, and non-intrusive 8.0 steps (0.6666666666666667 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission146\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 127.10605343321247 minutes (-0.049583580070958755 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to somewhat-intrusive 1.0 step, very-intrusive 4.0 steps, and non-intrusive 8.0 steps (+0.19999999999997276 in cost), and increase the collision to 1.3999999999998818 collisions (+0.03999999999997639 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in intrusiveness, and the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission146\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 1.000000000000722 collisions (-0.03999999999985557 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 136.96814133959438 minutes (+0.0704357891253462 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission146.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission146\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission146\/altPolicy2.json"]}
