{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission148\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission148\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.7999999999999999 collision (0.16 in cost); take 170.7830515205403 minutes (0.8659962232596486 in cost); and be non-intrusive 12.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps, and very-intrusive 1.0 step (0.9999999999999999 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission148\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 164.99528618974998 minutes (-0.029348245466703893 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 1.0 collision (+0.04000000000000001 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission148\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 0.6000000000001257 collision (-0.03999999999997486 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 179.6015389155697 minutes (+0.04471624503113991 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission148.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission148\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission148\/altPolicy2.json"]}
