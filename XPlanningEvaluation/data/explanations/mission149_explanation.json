{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission149\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission149\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.0 collision (0.0 in cost); take 192.67067967155066 minutes (0.3907930662741787 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 1.0 step, very-intrusive 3.0 steps, and non-intrusive 8.0 steps (0.33333333333333337 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness, and collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission149\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 188.01223199321302 minutes (-0.009448708310983489 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to somewhat-intrusive 3.0 steps, very-intrusive 3.0 steps, and non-intrusive 7.0 steps (+0.06666666666678134 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in intrusiveness.","Mission":"mission149.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission149\/altPolicy1.json"]}
