{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission155\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission155\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.2 collisions (0.36 in cost); take 125.58897208709811 minutes (1.831505842936848 in cost); and be very-intrusive 0.0 step, non-intrusive 7.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 6.0 steps (0.39999999999999997 in cost). It has the lowest expected time, and intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission155\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.999999999999226 collision (-0.0600000000002322 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 132.66773743572398 minutes (+0.10323199466746047 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission155.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission155\/altPolicy1.json"]}
