{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission162\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission162\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.6000000000000001 collision (0.24000000000000005 in cost); take 148.28747257962635 minutes (1.5038540425099538 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 1.0 step, very-intrusive 3.0 steps, and non-intrusive 8.0 steps (0.33333333333333337 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission162\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.4000000000005421 collision (-0.07999999999978319 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 158.80278690348607 minutes (+0.10664082190562496 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission162\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the time to 142.49970724896923 minutes (-0.05869649093205753 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.8000000000009617 collision (+0.08000000000038465 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission162.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission162\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission162\/altPolicy2.json"]}
