{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission164\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission164\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.4000000000000001 collisions (0.28 in cost); take 152.86788624021355 minutes (1.1627296528817612 in cost); and be non-intrusive 12.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps, and very-intrusive 1.0 step (0.8333333333333333 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission164\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 1.1999999999973903 collisions (-0.04000000000052195 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 158.65565157078123 minutes (+0.04402236819836247 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission164\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 1.0 collision (-0.08000000000000002 in cost), and reduce the time to 150.95044928069 minutes (-0.014584232602432357 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to non-intrusive 10.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 0.0 step, and very-intrusive 2.0 steps (+0.16666666666666674 in cost). The decrease in collision, and the decrease in time are not worth the increase in intrusiveness.","Mission":"mission164.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission164\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission164\/altPolicy2.json"]}
