{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission165\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission165\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.2000000000000002 collisions (0.12000000000000002 in cost); take 122.8744324800781 minutes (2.897564432032537 in cost); and be non-intrusive 5.0 steps, very-intrusive 6.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps (0.6666666666666666 in cost). It has the lowest expected time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission165\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.9999999999997414 collision (-0.020000000000025872 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 129.9531978288181 minutes (+0.16692796282529265 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission165\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the intrusiveness to non-intrusive 7.0 steps, very-intrusive 5.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps (-0.09999999999920584 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 131.34246077718186 minutes (+0.19968887837680116 in cost), and increase the collision to 1.4000000000010047 collisions (+0.020000000000100437 in cost). The decrease in intrusiveness is not worth the increase in time, and the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission165.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission165\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission165\/altPolicy2.json"]}
