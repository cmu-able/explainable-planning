It is expected to have 0.2 collision (0.08000000000000002 in cost); take 148.55603091988206 minutes (1.2962695091085992 in cost); and be very-intrusive 0.0 step, somewhat-intrusive 7.0 steps, and non-intrusive 5.0 steps (0.6999999999999998 in cost).\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission166\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 137.53292167618997 minutes (-0.09618539428989825 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.6000000000000001 collision (+0.16000000000000003 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission166\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the intrusiveness to very-intrusive 0.0 step, somewhat-intrusive 6.0 steps, and non-intrusive 6.0 steps (-0.09999999999999998 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 171.23714076963 minutes (+0.19791072061441395 in cost). The decrease in intrusiveness is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission166\/altPolicy3.json] would reduce the collision to 0.0 collision (-0.08000000000000002 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 159.83355399277468 minutes (+0.09840535727252675 in cost).
