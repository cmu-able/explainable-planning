{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission169\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission169\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.7999999999999998 collisions (0.18 in cost); take 130.98841946822267 minutes (2.7027914220943803 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps, very-intrusive 3.0 steps, and non-intrusive 8.0 steps (0.7333333333333334 in cost). It has the lowest expected time, and intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission169\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 1.4000000000011084 collisions (-0.03999999999988915 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 134.35858139474828 minutes (+0.06953931334588193 in cost), and increase the intrusiveness to somewhat-intrusive 3.0 steps, very-intrusive 3.0 steps, and non-intrusive 8.0 steps (+0.06666666666762378 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time, and the increase in intrusiveness.","Mission":"mission169.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission169\/altPolicy1.json"]}
