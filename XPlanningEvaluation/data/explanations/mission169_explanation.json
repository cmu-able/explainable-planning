{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission169\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission169\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.4 collision (0.04000000000000001 in cost); take 153.6167804583472 minutes (0.31158021951665466 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 5.0 steps, non-intrusive 7.0 steps, and very-intrusive 0.0 step (1.3333333333333333 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission169\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.19999999999971774 collision (-0.02000000000002823 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 164.80929122016278 minutes (+0.022701718846754704 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission169\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the time to 144.561315466158 minutes (-0.018367158598644906 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.6000000000005679 collision (+0.020000000000056778 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission169.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission169\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission169\/altPolicy2.json"]}
