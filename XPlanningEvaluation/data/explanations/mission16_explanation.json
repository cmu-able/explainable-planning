{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission16\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission16\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.0 collision (0.0 in cost); take 216.96739123768566 minutes (0.550092470269909 in cost); and be non-intrusive 12.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps, and very-intrusive 1.0 step (0.49999999999999994 in cost). It has the lowest expected collision, and intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission16\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 211.82019740223998 minutes (-0.013050037407679071 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.2 collision (+0.12 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission16.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission16\/altPolicy1.json"]}
