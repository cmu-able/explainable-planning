{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission172\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission172\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.4 collisions (0.27999999999999997 in cost); take 139.83687615407177 minutes (1.2365866634712763 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps, very-intrusive 3.0 steps, and non-intrusive 8.0 steps (1.8333333333333335 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission172\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 1.2000000000007667 collisions (-0.03999999999984663 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 149.5102189678893 minutes (+0.08554200468246198 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission172\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the time to 130.98841946824044 minutes (-0.07824748257352776 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 1.7999999999995562 collisions (+0.07999999999991131 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission172.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission172\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission172\/altPolicy2.json"]}
