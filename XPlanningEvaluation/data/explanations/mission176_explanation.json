{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission176\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission176\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.2 collisions (0.36 in cost); take 131.18037600837206 minutes (1.5964353723992495 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 1.0 step, very-intrusive 3.0 steps, and non-intrusive 8.0 steps (0.33333333333333337 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission176\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 127.10605343321247 minutes (-0.049583580070958755 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to somewhat-intrusive 1.0 step, very-intrusive 4.0 steps, and non-intrusive 8.0 steps (+0.09999999999998638 in cost), and increase the collision to 1.3999999999998818 collisions (+0.059999999999964526 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in intrusiveness, and the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission176\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 1.0000000000006262 collisions (-0.05999999999981215 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 136.9681413395827 minutes (+0.07043578912520432 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission176.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission176\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission176\/altPolicy2.json"]}
