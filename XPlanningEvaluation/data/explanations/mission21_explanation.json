{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission21\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission21\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.0 collision (0.0 in cost); take 192.67067967155066 minutes (0.3907930662741787 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 1.0 step, very-intrusive 3.0 steps, and non-intrusive 8.0 steps (1.6666666666666667 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness, and collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission21\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 190.01648387739 minutes (-0.005383493298826314 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.2 collision (+0.08000000000000002 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission21.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission21\/altPolicy1.json"]}
