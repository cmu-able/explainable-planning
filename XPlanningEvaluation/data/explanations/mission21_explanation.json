{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission21\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission21\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.0 collision (0.0 in cost); take 166.6977004613267 minutes (0.948615563281583 in cost); and be very-intrusive 3.0 steps, non-intrusive 4.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 6.0 steps (0.5 in cost). It has the lowest expected collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission21\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the intrusiveness to very-intrusive 2.0 steps, non-intrusive 6.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 6.0 steps (-0.09999999999960785 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 195.07971181055854 minutes (+0.16151163218572429 in cost). The decrease in intrusiveness is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission21\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the time to 157.8923675374 minutes (-0.05010792487476723 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.2 collision (+0.13999999999999999 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission21.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission21\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission21\/altPolicy2.json"]}
