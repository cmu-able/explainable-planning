{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission23\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission23\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.0 collision (0.0 in cost); take 159.8335539926903 minutes (0.9297832442535928 in cost); and be very-intrusive 0.0 step, somewhat-intrusive 7.0 steps, and non-intrusive 5.0 steps (0.4666666666666666 in cost). It has the lowest expected collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission23\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 148.55603091961171 minutes (-0.0656035715160993 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.1999999999994705 collision (+0.11999999999968229 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission23\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the intrusiveness to very-intrusive 0.0 step, somewhat-intrusive 6.0 steps, and non-intrusive 6.0 steps (-0.06666666666666665 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 182.51466384253 minutes (+0.13194048041014284 in cost). The decrease in intrusiveness is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission23.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission23\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission23\/altPolicy2.json"]}
