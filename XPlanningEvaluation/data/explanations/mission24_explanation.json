{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission24\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission24\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.6000000000000001 collision (0.24000000000000005 in cost); take 146.46835462216748 minutes (1.856756873714084 in cost); and be non-intrusive 6.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 5.0 steps, and very-intrusive 1.0 step (0.26666666666666666 in cost).\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission24\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 140.68058929127 minutes (-0.07337061366811781 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.8 collision (+0.08000000000000002 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission24\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 0.4 collision (-0.08000000000000002 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 154.64027496567002 minutes (+0.10359418120305608 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission24\/altPolicy3.json] would reduce the intrusiveness to non-intrusive 10.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 0.0 step, and very-intrusive 2.0 steps (-0.06666666666665236 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 1.0000000000008404 collisions (+0.16000000000033615 in cost), and increase the time to 150.950449280814 minutes (+0.05681882675303607 in cost). The decrease in intrusiveness is not worth the increase in collision, and the increase in time.","Mission":"mission24.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission24\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission24\/altPolicy2.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission24\/altPolicy3.json"]}
