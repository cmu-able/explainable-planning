{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission26\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission26\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.0 collision (0.0 in cost); take 174.0362448246809 minutes (1.0260092818134934 in cost); and be non-intrusive 7.0 steps, very-intrusive 5.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps (1.1333333333333333 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness, and collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission26\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 166.95747947598886 minutes (-0.04173199070604039 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.19999999999983614 collision (+0.11999999999990169 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission26.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission26\/altPolicy1.json"]}
