{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission27\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission27\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.2 collision (0.06 in cost); take 184.77381561806482 minutes (1.0893113101308671 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps, very-intrusive 3.0 steps, and non-intrusive 8.0 steps (1.8333333333333335 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission27\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 181.21547737057 minutes (-0.020977745603735665 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.4 collision (+0.06 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission27\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 0.0 collision (-0.06 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 195.28912994133935 minutes (+0.06199174262656881 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission27.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission27\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission27\/altPolicy2.json"]}
