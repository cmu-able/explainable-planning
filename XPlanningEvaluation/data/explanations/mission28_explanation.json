{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission28\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission28\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.0 collision (0.0 in cost); take 195.28912994158193 minutes (1.1513030527588655 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps, very-intrusive 3.0 steps, and non-intrusive 8.0 steps (1.1 in cost). It has the lowest expected collision, and intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission28\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 190.12768798183282 minutes (-0.030428646421203576 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.20000000000011464 collision (+0.10000000000005732 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission28.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission28\/altPolicy1.json"]}
