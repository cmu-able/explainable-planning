{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission30\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission30\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.4000000000000001 collisions (0.14 in cost); take 135.9787816394753 minutes (1.934513616299102 in cost); and be very-intrusive 2.0 steps, non-intrusive 6.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 6.0 steps (1.6 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission30\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.7999999999996215 collision (-0.060000000000037856 in cost), and reduce the time to 130.4622369209367 minutes (-0.07848158914403514 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to very-intrusive 3.0 steps, non-intrusive 4.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 6.0 steps (+0.39999999999808966 in cost). The decrease in collision, and the decrease in time are not worth the increase in intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission30\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 1.2 collisions (-0.020000000000000018 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 143.05754698823 minutes (+0.1007066528221987 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission30.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission30\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission30\/altPolicy2.json"]}
