{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission31\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission31\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.4000000000000001 collisions (0.14 in cost); take 152.86788624021355 minutes (0.7751531019211743 in cost); and be non-intrusive 12.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps, and very-intrusive 1.0 step (1.1666666666666665 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission31\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 1.0000000000000004 collisions (-0.039999999999999966 in cost), and reduce the time to 150.95044928069 minutes (-0.009722821734954978 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to non-intrusive 10.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 0.0 step, and very-intrusive 2.0 steps (+0.23333333333333361 in cost). The decrease in collision, and the decrease in time are not worth the increase in intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission31\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 1.1999999999973903 collisions (-0.020000000000260976 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 158.65565157078123 minutes (+0.029348245465575018 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission31.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission31\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission31\/altPolicy2.json"]}
