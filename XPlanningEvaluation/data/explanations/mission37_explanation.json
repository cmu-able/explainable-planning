{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission37\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission37\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.4 collisions (0.42 in cost); take 139.83687615407177 minutes (1.648782217961702 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps, very-intrusive 3.0 steps, and non-intrusive 8.0 steps (1.1 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission37\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 134.3585813946 minutes (-0.06459322628330022 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to somewhat-intrusive 3.0 steps, very-intrusive 3.0 steps, and non-intrusive 8.0 steps (+0.09999999999999987 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission37\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 1.2 collisions (-0.06 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 149.51021896775998 minutes (+0.11405600624175816 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission37.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission37\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission37\/altPolicy2.json"]}
