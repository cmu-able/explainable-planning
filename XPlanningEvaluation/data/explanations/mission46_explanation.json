{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission46\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission46\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.6000000000000001 collision (0.06000000000000001 in cost); take 138.8625899807392 minutes (0.33657959116554054 in cost); and be very-intrusive 1.0 step, non-intrusive 6.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 5.0 steps (2.1333333333333333 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission46\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 136.206078754741 minutes (-0.006438936955570018 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.7999999999994275 collision (+0.019999999999942744 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission46\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 0.39999999999841657 collision (-0.02000000000015835 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 148.3334787038854 minutes (+0.022955843289780398 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission46.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission46\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission46\/altPolicy2.json"]}
