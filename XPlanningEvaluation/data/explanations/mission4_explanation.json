{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission4\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission4\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.6 collision (0.12 in cost); take 196.02562938120244 minutes (1.1403196706196133 in cost); and be very-intrusive 0.0 step, somewhat-intrusive 4.0 steps, and non-intrusive 11.0 steps (0.7999999999999999 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission4\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 192.0812854862467 minutes (-0.022945024817952353 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.8000000000000973 collision (+0.040000000000019464 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission4\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 0.4 collision (-0.03999999999999998 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 203.10439472992852 minutes (+0.041178571375253714 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission4.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission4\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission4\/altPolicy2.json"]}
