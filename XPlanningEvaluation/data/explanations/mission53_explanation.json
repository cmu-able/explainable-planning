{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission53\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission53\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.2 collision (0.04000000000000001 in cost); take 172.6489077496328 minutes (0.35018299703610417 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 1.0 step, very-intrusive 3.0 steps, and non-intrusive 8.0 steps (2.3333333333333335 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission53\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.0 collision (-0.04000000000000001 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 192.67067967119377 minutes (+0.0406100692373505 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission53\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the time to 158.80278690314213 minutes (-0.028084024153685938 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.39999999999976543 collision (+0.03999999999995309 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission53.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission53\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission53\/altPolicy2.json"]}
