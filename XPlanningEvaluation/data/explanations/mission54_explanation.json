{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission54\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission54\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.0 collision (0.2 in cost); take 138.57716744061383 minutes (1.225446976732248 in cost); and be non-intrusive 7.0 steps, very-intrusive 5.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps (2.833333333333333 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission54\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 131.34246077709724 minutes (-0.06397698532949447 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 1.4000000000004813 collisions (+0.08000000000009627 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission54\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 0.799999999998372 collision (-0.04000000000032561 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 145.65593278906587 minutes (+0.06259798605693812 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission54.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission54\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission54\/altPolicy2.json"]}
