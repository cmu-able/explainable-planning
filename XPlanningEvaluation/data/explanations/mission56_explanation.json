{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission56\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission56\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.2 collision (0.08000000000000002 in cost); take 160.42804029662489 minutes (1.6269773348687888 in cost); and be non-intrusive 6.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 5.0 steps, and very-intrusive 1.0 step (0.5333333333333333 in cost).\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission56\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.0 collision (-0.08000000000000002 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 169.79901613654386 minutes (+0.09503553910501705 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission56\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the intrusiveness to non-intrusive 10.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 0.0 step, and very-intrusive 2.0 steps (-0.13333333333330472 in cost), and reduce the time to 150.950449280814 minutes (-0.0961167744950926 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 1.0000000000008404 collisions (+0.3200000000003362 in cost). The decrease in intrusiveness, and the decrease in time are not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission56.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission56\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission56\/altPolicy2.json"]}
