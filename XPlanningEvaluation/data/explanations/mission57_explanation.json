{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission57\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission57\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.0 collision (0.0 in cost); take 178.65541206668777 minutes (0.36236596251716474 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 5.0 steps, non-intrusive 7.0 steps, and very-intrusive 0.0 step (0.8333333333333333 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness, and collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission57\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 169.5999470742669 minutes (-0.018367158599114752 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.1999999999996167 collision (+0.0799999999998467 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission57.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission57\/altPolicy1.json"]}
