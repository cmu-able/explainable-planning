{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission59\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission59\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.6000000000000001 collision (0.18000000000000002 in cost); take 138.8625899807392 minutes (1.3463183646621621 in cost); and be very-intrusive 1.0 step, non-intrusive 6.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 5.0 steps (0.7999999999999999 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission59\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 136.2060787547394 minutes (-0.02575574782229495 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.7999999999994228 collision (+0.05999999999982683 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission59\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 0.39999999999841657 collision (-0.06000000000047506 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 148.3334787038854 minutes (+0.09182337315912159 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission59.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission59\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission59\/altPolicy2.json"]}
