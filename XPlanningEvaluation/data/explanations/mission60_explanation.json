{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission60\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission60\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.4 collisions (0.13999999999999999 in cost); take 131.3424607769093 minutes (2.7100966466025462 in cost); and be non-intrusive 7.0 steps, very-intrusive 5.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps (1.1333333333333333 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission60\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 129.95319782872087 minutes (-0.028665801103951782 in cost), and reduce the collision to 0.9999999999992265 collision (-0.040000000000077335 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to non-intrusive 5.0 steps, very-intrusive 6.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps (+0.19999999999911156 in cost). The decrease in time, and the decrease in collision are not worth the increase in intrusiveness.","Mission":"mission60.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission60\/altPolicy1.json"]}
