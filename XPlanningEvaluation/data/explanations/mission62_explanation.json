{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission62\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission62\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.6000000000000001 collision (0.06000000000000001 in cost); take 196.02562938120244 minutes (0.5701598353098066 in cost); and be very-intrusive 0.0 step, somewhat-intrusive 4.0 steps, and non-intrusive 11.0 steps (1.0666666666666667 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission62\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 192.08128548622787 minutes (-0.011472512409031022 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.7999999999998438 collision (+0.019999999999984377 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission62\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 0.4 collision (-0.020000000000000004 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 203.1043947299275 minutes (+0.02058928568762397 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission62.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission62\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission62\/altPolicy2.json"]}
