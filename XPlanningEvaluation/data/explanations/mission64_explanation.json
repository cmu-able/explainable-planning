{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission64\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission64\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.0 collision (0.2 in cost); take 126.2135904358939 minutes (1.4684185973834567 in cost); and be very-intrusive 0.0 step, somewhat-intrusive 7.0 steps, and non-intrusive 5.0 steps (0.9333333333333332 in cost).\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission64\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.6000000000000855 collision (-0.07999999999998292 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 137.2366996796242 minutes (+0.12824719238697613 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission64\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the intrusiveness to very-intrusive 0.0 step, somewhat-intrusive 6.0 steps, and non-intrusive 6.0 steps (-0.13333333333322128 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 1.399999999999865 collisions (+0.07999999999997298 in cost), and increase the time to 133.95171936351673 minutes (+0.0900284381977361 in cost). The decrease in intrusiveness is not worth the increase in collision, and the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission64\/altPolicy3.json] would reduce the time to 124.83171368104652 minutes (-0.016077298166558673 in cost).

The decrease in time is not worth the increase in intrusiveness, and the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission64.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission64\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission64\/altPolicy2.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission64\/altPolicy3.json"]}
