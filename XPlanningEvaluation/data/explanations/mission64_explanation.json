{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission64\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission64\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.7999999999999998 collisions (0.18 in cost); take 130.98841946822267 minutes (3.088904482393578 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps, very-intrusive 3.0 steps, and non-intrusive 8.0 steps (0.3666666666666667 in cost). It has the lowest expected time, and intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission64\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 1.4000000000011 collisions (-0.039999999999889985 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 134.35858139474755 minutes (+0.07947350096670514 in cost), and increase the intrusiveness to somewhat-intrusive 3.0 steps, very-intrusive 3.0 steps, and non-intrusive 8.0 steps (+0.03333333333381283 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time, and the increase in intrusiveness.","Mission":"mission64.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission64\/altPolicy1.json"]}
