{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission65\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission65\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.5999999999999999 collisions (0.16 in cost); take 133.0352840001666 minutes (1.6864678971168694 in cost); and be non-intrusive 10.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 0.0 step, and very-intrusive 2.0 steps (0.8 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission65\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 1.399999999996983 collisions (-0.020000000000301693 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 138.82304933101452 minutes (+0.07337061366748987 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission65\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 1.1999999999987072 collisions (-0.04000000000012928 in cost), and reduce the time to 128.58891077405187 minutes (-0.0563659916299577 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to non-intrusive 6.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 5.0 steps, and very-intrusive 1.0 step (+0.26666666666399386 in cost). The decrease in collision, and the decrease in time are not worth the increase in intrusiveness.","Mission":"mission65.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission65\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission65\/altPolicy2.json"]}
