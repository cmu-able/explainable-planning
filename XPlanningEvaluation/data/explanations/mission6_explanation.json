{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission6\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission6\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.39999999999999997 collision (0.08 in cost); take 153.6167804583472 minutes (0.6231604390333093 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 5.0 steps, non-intrusive 7.0 steps, and very-intrusive 0.0 step (0.9999999999999999 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission6\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 144.561315466158 minutes (-0.03673431719728981 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.6000000000005679 collision (+0.04000000000011357 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission6\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 0.1999999999997177 collision (-0.040000000000056456 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 164.80929122016278 minutes (+0.04540343769350941 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission6.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission6\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission6\/altPolicy2.json"]}
