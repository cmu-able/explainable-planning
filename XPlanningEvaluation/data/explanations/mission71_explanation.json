{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission71\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission71\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.0 collision (0.0 in cost); take 176.8330555142223 minutes (0.5157630785831485 in cost); and be very-intrusive 0.0 step, non-intrusive 7.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 6.0 steps (0.19999999999999998 in cost). It has the lowest expected collision, and intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission71\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 171.98285047609522 minutes (-0.01414643136120386 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.1999999999997718 collision (+0.15999999999981745 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission71.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission71\/altPolicy1.json"]}
