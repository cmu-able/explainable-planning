{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission72\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission72\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.4 collision (0.24 in cost); take 129.8293949081061 minutes (1.1480898507273678 in cost); and be non-intrusive 7.0 steps, very-intrusive 2.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 4.0 steps (0.3333333333333334 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission72\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.19999999999974116 collision (-0.1200000000001553 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 143.45786560794372 minutes (+0.12051745987488904 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission72\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 0.2 collision (-0.12 in cost), and reduce the time to 122.93743509005999 minutes (-0.060946052504674775 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to non-intrusive 6.0 steps, very-intrusive 4.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 4.0 steps (+0.1999999999999999 in cost). The decrease in collision, and the decrease in time are not worth the increase in intrusiveness.","Mission":"mission72.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission72\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission72\/altPolicy2.json"]}
