{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission73\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission73\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.4 collision (0.08000000000000002 in cost); take 129.8293949081061 minutes (0.3826966169091226 in cost); and be non-intrusive 7.0 steps, very-intrusive 2.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 4.0 steps (2.3333333333333335 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission73\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 120.15605209464402 minutes (-0.02851400155977296 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.6000000000004421 collision (+0.04000000000008841 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission73\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 0.19999999999974116 collision (-0.04000000000005178 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 143.45786560794372 minutes (+0.04017248662496303 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission73.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission73\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission73\/altPolicy2.json"]}
