{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission74\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission74\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.0 collision (0.0 in cost); take 195.28912994158193 minutes (0.5756515263794327 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps, very-intrusive 3.0 steps, and non-intrusive 8.0 steps (1.4666666666666668 in cost). It has the lowest expected collision, and intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission74\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 190.12768798176995 minutes (-0.015214323210786862 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.2 collision (+0.1 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission74.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission74\/altPolicy1.json"]}
