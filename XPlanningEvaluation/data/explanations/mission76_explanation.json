{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission76\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission76\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.4 collisions (0.13999999999999999 in cost); take 131.3424607769093 minutes (2.3229399828021826 in cost); and be non-intrusive 7.0 steps, very-intrusive 5.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps (1.6999999999999997 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission76\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 129.95319782872312 minutes (-0.02457068666049045 in cost), and reduce the collision to 0.9999999999992368 collision (-0.040000000000076294 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to non-intrusive 5.0 steps, very-intrusive 6.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps (+0.2999999999986924 in cost). The decrease in time, and the decrease in collision are not worth the increase in intrusiveness.","Mission":"mission76.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission76\/altPolicy1.json"]}
