{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission7\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission7\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.2 collision (0.1 in cost); take 159.61100177694246 minutes (1.16061076776093 in cost); and be very-intrusive 1.0 step, non-intrusive 6.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 5.0 steps (0.5333333333333333 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission7\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 152.77254575247028 minutes (-0.049725805918778176 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.3999999999997556 collision (+0.0999999999998778 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission7\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 0.0 collision (-0.1 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 173.52095754905272 minutes (+0.10114618834828759 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission7.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission7\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission7\/altPolicy2.json"]}
