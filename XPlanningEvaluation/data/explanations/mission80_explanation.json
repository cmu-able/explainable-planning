{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission80\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission80\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.5999999999999999 collisions (0.32 in cost); take 133.0352840001666 minutes (1.3491743176934956 in cost); and be non-intrusive 10.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 0.0 step, and very-intrusive 2.0 steps (0.8 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission80\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 1.399999999996983 collisions (-0.040000000000603386 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 138.82304933101452 minutes (+0.058696490933991985 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission80\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 1.2000000000015179 collisions (-0.07999999999969643 in cost), and reduce the time to 128.5889107743664 minutes (-0.045092793300776535 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to non-intrusive 6.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 5.0 steps, and very-intrusive 1.0 step (+0.2666666666674089 in cost). The decrease in collision, and the decrease in time are not worth the increase in intrusiveness.","Mission":"mission80.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission80\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission80\/altPolicy2.json"]}
