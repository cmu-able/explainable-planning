{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission81\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission81\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.0 collision (0.1 in cost); take 126.2135904358939 minutes (2.202627896075185 in cost); and be very-intrusive 0.0 step, somewhat-intrusive 7.0 steps, and non-intrusive 5.0 steps (0.6999999999999998 in cost).\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission81\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the intrusiveness to very-intrusive 0.0 step, somewhat-intrusive 6.0 steps, and non-intrusive 6.0 steps (-0.09999999999991593 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 1.3999999999998822 collisions (+0.03999999999998821 in cost), and increase the time to 133.9517193635187 minutes (+0.13504265729663922 in cost). The decrease in intrusiveness is not worth the increase in collision, and the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission81\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the time to 124.83171368106437 minutes (-0.024115947249526037 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to very-intrusive 3.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 5.0 steps, and non-intrusive 5.0 steps (+0.6999999999998857 in cost), and increase the collision to 1.5999999999997339 collisions (+0.05999999999997338 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in intrusiveness, and the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission81\/altPolicy3.json] would reduce the collision to 0.6000000000000997 collision (-0.03999999999999004 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 137.23669967966956 minutes (+0.19237078858125578 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission81.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission81\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission81\/altPolicy2.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission81\/altPolicy3.json"]}
