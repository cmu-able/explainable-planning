{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission91\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission91\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.2000000000000002 collisions (0.24000000000000005 in cost); take 122.8744324800781 minutes (2.535368878028469 in cost); and be non-intrusive 5.0 steps, very-intrusive 6.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps (0.6666666666666666 in cost). It has the lowest expected time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission91\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the intrusiveness to non-intrusive 7.0 steps, very-intrusive 5.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps (-0.0999999999992166 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 131.34246077718007 minutes (+0.1747277685796651 in cost), and increase the collision to 1.4000000000009947 collisions (+0.040000000000198876 in cost). The decrease in intrusiveness is not worth the increase in time, and the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission91\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 0.9999999999997446 collision (-0.040000000000051106 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 129.95319782882083 minutes (+0.1460619674721868 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission91.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission91\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission91\/altPolicy2.json"]}
