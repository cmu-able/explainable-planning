{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission99\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission99\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.2 collision (0.06 in cost); take 166.3177411907052 minutes (0.9701868236124472 in cost); and be very-intrusive 0.0 step, non-intrusive 7.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 6.0 steps (0.9999999999999999 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission99\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.0 collision (-0.06 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 176.8330555137477 minutes (+0.06133933355108134 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission99\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the time to 156.64439837725863 minutes (-0.05642783307843846 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.4000000000003508 collision (+0.06000000000010523 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission99.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission99\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission99\/altPolicy2.json"]}
