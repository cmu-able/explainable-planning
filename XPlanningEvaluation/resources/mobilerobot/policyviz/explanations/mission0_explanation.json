{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission0\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission0\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.0 collision (0.3 in cost); take 151.1562073943625 minutes (1.3366842517192794 in cost); and be non-intrusive 8.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps, and very-intrusive 3.0000000000000004 steps (1.466666666666667 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission0\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 149.5102189677057 minutes (-0.014555583567164243 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 1.1999999999998812 collisions (+0.05999999999996436 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission0\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 0.9600000000000003 collision (-0.0119999999999999 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 153.09087595718006 minutes (+0.017108400936970414 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission0.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission0\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission0\/altPolicy2.json"]}
