{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission100\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission100\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.0 collision (0.0 in cost); take 216.96739123768566 minutes (0.550092470269909 in cost); and be non-intrusive 12.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps, and very-intrusive 1.0 step (0.3333333333333333 in cost). It has the lowest expected collision, and intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission100\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 214.64789904849 minutes (-0.0058807693674510775 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to non-intrusive 10.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 4.0 steps, and very-intrusive 1.0 step (+0.1333333333333333 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in intrusiveness.","Mission":"mission100.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission100\/altPolicy1.json"]}
