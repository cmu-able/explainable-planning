{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission101\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission101\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.2 collisions (0.12 in cost); take 125.58897208709811 minutes (0.3663011685873696 in cost); and be very-intrusive 0.0 step, non-intrusive 7.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 6.0 steps (1.5999999999999999 in cost). It has the lowest expected time, and intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission101\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.9999999999986373 collision (-0.020000000000136256 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 132.66773743567106 minutes (+0.020646398933337695 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission101.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission101\/altPolicy1.json"]}
