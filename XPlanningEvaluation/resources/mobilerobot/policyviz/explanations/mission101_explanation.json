{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission101\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission101\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.2 collisions (0.12 in cost); take 125.58897208709814 minutes (0.36630116858736966 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 6.000000000000001 steps, very-intrusive 0.0 step, and non-intrusive 7.0 steps (1.5999999999999996 in cost). It has the lowest expected time, and intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission101\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 1.1600000000000001 collisions (-0.003999999999999976 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 127.00472515680603 minutes (+0.004129279786648066 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission101.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission101\/altPolicy1.json"]}
