{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission102\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission102\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.2 collisions (0.24 in cost); take 131.18037600837206 minutes (1.8625079344657909 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 1.0 step, very-intrusive 3.0 steps, and non-intrusive 8.0 steps (0.33333333333333337 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission102\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 127.10605343321247 minutes (-0.0578475100827851 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to somewhat-intrusive 1.0 step, very-intrusive 4.0 steps, and non-intrusive 8.0 steps (+0.09999999999998638 in cost), and increase the collision to 1.3999999999998818 collisions (+0.03999999999997639 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in intrusiveness, and the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission102\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 1.0 collision (-0.03999999999999998 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 136.96814133949 minutes (+0.08217508731142198 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission102.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission102\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission102\/altPolicy2.json"]}
