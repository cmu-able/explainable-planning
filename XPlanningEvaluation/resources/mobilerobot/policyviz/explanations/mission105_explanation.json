{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission105\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission105\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.6000000000000001 collision (0.06000000000000001 in cost); take 120.15605209451877 minutes (2.8334609227918444 in cost); and be non-intrusive 7.0 steps, very-intrusive 2.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 4.0 steps (0.3333333333333334 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness, and time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission105\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.3999999999999999 collision (-0.020000000000000018 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 129.82939490818995 minutes (+0.2281120124831144 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission105.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission105\/altPolicy1.json"]}
