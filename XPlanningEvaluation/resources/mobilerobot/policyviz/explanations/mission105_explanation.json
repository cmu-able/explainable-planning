{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission105\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission105\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.6000000000000001 collision (0.24000000000000005 in cost); take 148.28747257962635 minutes (1.2030832340079631 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 1.0 step, very-intrusive 3.0 steps, and non-intrusive 8.0 steps (0.6666666666666667 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission105\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.40000000000054126 collision (-0.07999999999978352 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 158.80278690348752 minutes (+0.08531265752451178 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission105\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the time to 142.49970724896613 minutes (-0.046957192745670895 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.8000000000009235 collision (+0.08000000000036939 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission105.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission105\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission105\/altPolicy2.json"]}
