{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission108\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission108\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.6000000000000001 collision (0.06000000000000001 in cost); take 120.1560520945188 minutes (2.479278307442864 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 4.0 steps, very-intrusive 2.0 steps, and non-intrusive 7.0 steps (0.666666666666667 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness, and time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission108\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.56 collision (-0.0040000000000000036 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 122.92527626389004 minutes (+0.057139672050540824 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission108.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission108\/altPolicy1.json"]}
