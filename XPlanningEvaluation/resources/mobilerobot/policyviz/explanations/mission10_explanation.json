{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission10\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission10\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.0 collision (0.0 in cost); take 195.28912994158196 minutes (1.1513030527588657 in cost); and be non-intrusive 8.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps, and very-intrusive 3.0000000000000004 steps (1.466666666666667 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness, and collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission10\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 192.28988869268082 minutes (-0.01768165799526611 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.16000000000000003 collision (+0.06400000000000002 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission10.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission10\/altPolicy1.json"]}
