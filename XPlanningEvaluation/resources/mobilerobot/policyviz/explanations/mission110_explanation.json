{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission110\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission110\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.4 collision (0.16000000000000003 in cost); take 158.80278690314347 minutes (0.9662969186472627 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 1.0 step, very-intrusive 3.0 steps, and non-intrusive 8.0 steps (1.0 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission110\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 148.2874725793905 minutes (-0.06398449314272603 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.5999999999991004 collision (+0.07999999999964014 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission110\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 0.20000000000008958 collision (-0.0799999999999642 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 172.64890774992827 minutes (+0.08425207246284772 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission110.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission110\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission110\/altPolicy2.json"]}
