{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission111\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission111\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.0 collision (0.4 in cost); take 143.20703808041097 minutes (2.1106487105535807 in cost); and be non-intrusive 8.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 3.0 steps, and very-intrusive 3.0 steps (0.4 in cost).\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission111\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the intrusiveness to non-intrusive 8.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps, and very-intrusive 3.0000000000000004 steps (-0.03333333333619071 in cost), and reduce the time to 139.83687615367447 minutes (-0.049670938107308604 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 1.3999999999943271 collisions (+0.15999999999773085 in cost). The decrease in intrusiveness, and the decrease in time are not worth the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission111\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 0.9200000000000002 collision (-0.03199999999999992 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 148.67060488527804 minutes (+0.08052446574058036 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission111.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission111\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission111\/altPolicy2.json"]}
