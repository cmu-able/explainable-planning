{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission111\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission111\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.0 collision (0.0 in cost); take 173.52095754866792 minutes (0.42058565203547316 in cost); and be very-intrusive 1.0 step, non-intrusive 6.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 5.0 steps (1.8666666666666665 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness, and collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission111\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 167.15722260402003 minutes (-0.015424624488514338 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.20000000000000007 collision (+0.040000000000000015 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission111.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission111\/altPolicy1.json"]}
