{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission113\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission113\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.0 collision (0.0 in cost); take 159.8335539926903 minutes (0.9297832442535928 in cost); and be very-intrusive 0.0 step, somewhat-intrusive 7.0 steps, and non-intrusive 5.0 steps (0.6999999999999998 in cost). It has the lowest expected collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission113\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 148.5560309196154 minutes (-0.06560357151607765 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.19999999999947776 collision (+0.09999999999973888 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission113\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the intrusiveness to very-intrusive 0.0 step, somewhat-intrusive 6.0 steps, and non-intrusive 6.0 steps (-0.09999999999999998 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 182.51466384253 minutes (+0.13194048041014284 in cost). The decrease in intrusiveness is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission113.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission113\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission113\/altPolicy2.json"]}
