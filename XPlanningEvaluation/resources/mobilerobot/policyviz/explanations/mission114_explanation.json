{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission114\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission114\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.6000000000000001 collision (0.24000000000000005 in cost); take 135.4751500893468 minutes (1.541878927627769 in cost); and be non-intrusive 4.0 steps, very-intrusive 3.0000000000000004 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 6.000000000000001 steps (1.0 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission114\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.56 collision (-0.016000000000000014 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 138.20084422937 minutes (+0.03102185422853232 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission114\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the time to 133.05681438595872 minutes (-0.02752372563178418 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.6799999999994967 collision (+0.031999999999798634 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission114.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission114\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission114\/altPolicy2.json"]}
