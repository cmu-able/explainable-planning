{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission115\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission115\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.5999999999999999 collisions (0.16 in cost); take 133.0352840001666 minutes (1.3491743176934956 in cost); and be non-intrusive 10.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 0.0 step, and very-intrusive 2.0 steps (1.0 in cost).\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission115\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 1.4000000000001027 collisions (-0.01999999999998972 in cost), and reduce the intrusiveness to non-intrusive 12.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps, and very-intrusive 1.0 step (-0.16666666666639351 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 152.8678862403755 minutes (+0.20113188615049582 in cost). The decrease in collision, and the decrease in intrusiveness are not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission115\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 1.1999999999986877 collisions (-0.040000000000131236 in cost), and reduce the time to 128.5889107740497 minutes (-0.04509279330398863 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to non-intrusive 6.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 5.0 steps, and very-intrusive 1.0 step (+0.3333333333299584 in cost). The decrease in collision, and the decrease in time are not worth the increase in intrusiveness.","Mission":"mission115.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission115\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission115\/altPolicy2.json"]}
