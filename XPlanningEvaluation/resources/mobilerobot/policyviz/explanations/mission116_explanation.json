{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission116\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission116\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.4000000000000001 collisions (0.14 in cost); take 135.9787816394753 minutes (2.321416339558922 in cost); and be very-intrusive 2.0 steps, non-intrusive 6.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 6.0 steps (1.2 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission116\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.9999999999988586 collision (-0.04000000000011415 in cost), and reduce the time to 123.38347157229066 minutes (-0.21502589035762565 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to very-intrusive 3.0 steps, non-intrusive 4.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 6.0 steps (+0.2999999999971923 in cost). The decrease in collision, and the decrease in time are not worth the increase in intrusiveness.","Mission":"mission116.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission116\/altPolicy1.json"]}
