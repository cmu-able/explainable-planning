{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission118\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission118\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.6000000000000001 collision (0.12000000000000002 in cost); take 148.28747257962635 minutes (0.9023124255059722 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 1.0 step, very-intrusive 3.0 steps, and non-intrusive 8.0 steps (1.6666666666666667 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission118\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.4000000000005316 collision (-0.039999999999893704 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 158.80278690348518 minutes (+0.06398449314336963 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission118\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the time to 142.49970724896974 minutes (-0.03521789455923119 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.8000000000009472 collision (+0.04000000000018941 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission118.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission118\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission118\/altPolicy2.json"]}
