{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission11\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission11\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.6000000000000001 collision (0.24000000000000005 in cost); take 154.5263693207016 minutes (1.821982419440202 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 3.0 steps, very-intrusive 3.0 steps, and non-intrusive 8.0 steps (0.8 in cost).\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission11\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.4 collision (-0.08000000000000002 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 164.51094905647997 minutes (+0.11772572425054673 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission11\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the time to 151.1562073943419 minutes (-0.039736750481405236 in cost), and reduce the intrusiveness to somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps, very-intrusive 3.0 steps, and non-intrusive 8.0 steps (-0.06666666666720811 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.999999999999337 collision (+0.15999999999973474 in cost). The decrease in time, and the decrease in intrusiveness are not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission11.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission11\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission11\/altPolicy2.json"]}
