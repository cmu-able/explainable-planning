{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission123\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission123\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.4 collisions (0.42 in cost); take 134.35858139456187 minutes (2.376283487516927 in cost); and be non-intrusive 8.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 3.0 steps, and very-intrusive 3.0 steps (0.4 in cost).\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission123\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the intrusiveness to non-intrusive 8.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps, and very-intrusive 3.0000000000000004 steps (-0.03333333333619065 in cost), and reduce the time to 130.988419467804 minutes (-0.05960512572914922 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 1.7999999999943304 collisions (+0.11999999999829908 in cost). The decrease in intrusiveness, and the decrease in time are not worth the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission123\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 1.3199999999988619 collisions (-0.024000000000341415 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 137.35127364489986 minutes (+0.05292914753851319 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission123.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission123\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission123\/altPolicy2.json"]}
