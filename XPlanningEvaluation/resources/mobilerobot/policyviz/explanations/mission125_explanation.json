{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission125\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission125\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.6000000000000001 collision (0.06000000000000001 in cost); take 148.28747257962635 minutes (0.3007708085019908 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 1.0 step, very-intrusive 3.0 steps, and non-intrusive 8.0 steps (2.666666666666667 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission125\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.4000000000005316 collision (-0.019999999999946852 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 158.80278690348518 minutes (+0.021328164381123227 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission125\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the time to 142.49970724896932 minutes (-0.011739298186411173 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.8000000000009633 collision (+0.020000000000096316 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission125.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission125\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission125\/altPolicy2.json"]}
