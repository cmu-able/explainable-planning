{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission126\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission126\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.4 collision (0.16000000000000003 in cost); take 171.36184799689013 minutes (1.4627362781191044 in cost); and be non-intrusive 6.0 steps, very-intrusive 2.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 6.000000000000001 steps (1.2 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission126\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 167.95066999879364 minutes (-0.029117647056583706 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.48000000000062926 collision (+0.03200000000025169 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission126\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 0.35999999999962506 collision (-0.016000000000150005 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 174.0875421367053 minutes (+0.02326639066962355 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission126.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission126\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission126\/altPolicy2.json"]}
