{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission126\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission126\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.4 collision (0.16000000000000003 in cost); take 171.3618479968901 minutes (1.4627362781191044 in cost); and be very-intrusive 2.0 steps, non-intrusive 6.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 6.0 steps (1.2 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission126\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 164.2830826484312 minutes (-0.06042399169079449 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.6000000000005787 collision (+0.08000000000023147 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission126\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 0.2000000000000958 collision (-0.07999999999996171 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 181.45124111017546 minutes (+0.08612256172258004 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission126.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission126\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission126\/altPolicy2.json"]}
