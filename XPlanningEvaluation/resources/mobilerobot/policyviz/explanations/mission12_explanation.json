{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission12\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission12\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.2 collision (0.1 in cost); take 148.55603091988206 minutes (1.7283593454781323 in cost); and be very-intrusive 0.0 step, somewhat-intrusive 7.0 steps, and non-intrusive 5.0 steps (0.2333333333333333 in cost).\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission12\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the intrusiveness to very-intrusive 0.0 step, somewhat-intrusive 6.0 steps, and non-intrusive 6.0 steps (-0.033333333333333326 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 171.23714076963 minutes (+0.2638809608192185 in cost). The decrease in intrusiveness is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission12\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 0.0 collision (-0.1 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 159.83355399238147 minutes (+0.13120714302546 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission12\/altPolicy3.json] would reduce the time to 137.53292167618997 minutes (-0.12824719238653093 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.6000000000000001 collision (+0.20000000000000004 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission12.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission12\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission12\/altPolicy2.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission12\/altPolicy3.json"]}
