{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission130\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission130\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.4 collision (0.12 in cost); take 134.07883924894114 minutes (1.0878060076789822 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 6.0 steps, non-intrusive 8.0 steps, and very-intrusive 0.0 step (0.5999999999999999 in cost).\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission130\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the intrusiveness to somewhat-intrusive 5.0 steps, non-intrusive 7.0 steps, and very-intrusive 0.0 step (-0.10000000000037196 in cost), and reduce the time to 129.5865255500377 minutes (-0.036446958054078715 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.9999999999989881 collision (+0.17999999999969646 in cost). The decrease in intrusiveness, and the decrease in time are not worth the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission130\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 0.1999999999992518 collision (-0.06000000000022446 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 143.13430424088276 minutes (+0.07346863439257145 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission130.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission130\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission130\/altPolicy2.json"]}
