{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission130\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission130\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.0 collision (0.0 in cost); take 176.83305551422237 minutes (1.0315261571662973 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 6.000000000000001 steps, very-intrusive 0.0 step, and non-intrusive 7.0 steps (0.7999999999999998 in cost). It has the lowest expected collision, and intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission130\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 174.89838695119 minutes (-0.011285566617688536 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.03999999999964839 collision (+0.01599999999985936 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission130.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission130\/altPolicy1.json"]}
