{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission132\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission132\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.0 collision (0.0 in cost); take 157.30398645437901 minutes (0.4636831549975175 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 4.0 steps, very-intrusive 2.0 steps, and non-intrusive 7.0 steps (1.0000000000000002 in cost). It has the lowest expected collision, and intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission132\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 154.5347622851462 minutes (-0.008162810292526412 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.03999999999998799 collision (+0.023999999999992794 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission132.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission132\/altPolicy1.json"]}
