It is expected to have 1.0 collision (0.2 in cost); take 126.2135904358939 minutes (2.202627896075185 in cost); and be very-intrusive 0.0 step, somewhat-intrusive 7.0 steps, and non-intrusive 5.0 steps (0.4666666666666666 in cost).\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission134\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.6000000000000997 collision (-0.07999999999998007 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 137.23669967963525 minutes (+0.19237078858065715 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission134\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the time to 124.83171368191333 minutes (-0.024115947234710777 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to very-intrusive 3.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 5.0 steps, and non-intrusive 5.0 steps (+0.46666666667504536 in cost), and increase the collision to 1.6000000000076193 collisions (+0.12000000000152389 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in intrusiveness, and the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission134\/altPolicy3.json] would reduce the intrusiveness to very-intrusive 0.0 step, somewhat-intrusive 6.0 steps, and non-intrusive 6.0 steps (-0.06666666666666665 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 1.4 collisions (+0.07999999999999996 in cost), and increase the time to 133.95171936353 minutes (+0.1350426572968364 in cost). The decrease in intrusiveness is not worth the increase in collision, and the increase in time.","Mission":"mission134.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission134\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission134\/altPolicy2.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission134\/altPolicy3.json"]}
