{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission138\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission138\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.6000000000000001 collision (0.18000000000000002 in cost); take 148.28747257962635 minutes (1.2030832340079631 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 1.0 step, very-intrusive 3.0 steps, and non-intrusive 8.0 steps (1.0 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission138\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.40000000000053126 collision (-0.05999999999984065 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 158.80278690348229 minutes (+0.08531265752446937 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission138\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the time to 142.49970724896576 minutes (-0.04695719274567378 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.8000000000009194 collision (+0.060000000000275805 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission138.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission138\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission138\/altPolicy2.json"]}
