{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission138\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission138\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.0 collision (0.3 in cost); take 138.57716744061383 minutes (1.6339293023096642 in cost); and be non-intrusive 7.0 steps, very-intrusive 5.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps (1.6999999999999997 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission138\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.8800000000000466 collision (-0.03599999999998599 in cost), and reduce the time to 137.08413386668974 minutes (-0.01760399170240068 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to non-intrusive 6.2 steps, very-intrusive 5.4 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps (+0.12000000000149735 in cost). The decrease in collision, and the decrease in time are not worth the increase in intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission138\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 0.9600000000000173 collision (-0.011999999999994793 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 140.4713451853818 minutes (+0.022333783971198784 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission138.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission138\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission138\/altPolicy2.json"]}
