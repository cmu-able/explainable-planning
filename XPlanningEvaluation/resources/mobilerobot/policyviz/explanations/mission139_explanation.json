{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission139\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission139\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.2 collision (0.1 in cost); take 153.06922976154317 minutes (1.306591391568216 in cost); and be very-intrusive 3.0 steps, non-intrusive 4.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 6.0 steps (1.0 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission139\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 150.81360218871998 minutes (-0.019253925650673853 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.40000000000000013 collision (+0.10000000000000006 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission139\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 0.0 collision (-0.1 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 166.69770046114277 minutes (+0.11633195335258861 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission139.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission139\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission139\/altPolicy2.json"]}
