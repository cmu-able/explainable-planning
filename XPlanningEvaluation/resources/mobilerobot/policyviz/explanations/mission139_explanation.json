{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission139\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission139\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.20000000000000004 collision (0.10000000000000002 in cost); take 153.0692297615432 minutes (1.306591391568216 in cost); and be non-intrusive 4.0 steps, very-intrusive 3.0000000000000004 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 6.000000000000001 steps (1.0 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission139\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.16000000000000003 collision (-0.020000000000000004 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 155.79492390155 minutes (+0.02326639067125935 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission139\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the time to 150.65089405797065 minutes (-0.020642794225412597 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.27999999999933334 collision (+0.03999999999966665 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission139.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission139\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission139\/altPolicy2.json"]}
