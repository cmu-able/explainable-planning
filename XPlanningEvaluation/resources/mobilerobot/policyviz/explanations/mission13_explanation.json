{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission13\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission13\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.0 collision (0.0 in cost); take 218.04737565191465 minutes (0.6342122516523997 in cost); and be very-intrusive 0.0 step, somewhat-intrusive 4.0 steps, and non-intrusive 11.0 steps (0.5333333333333334 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness, and collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission13\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 210.96861030331115 minutes (-0.020589285687270142 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.20000000000002227 collision (+0.10000000000001114 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission13.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission13\/altPolicy1.json"]}
