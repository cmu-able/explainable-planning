{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission140\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission140\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.4 collisions (0.13999999999999999 in cost); take 152.86788624021355 minutes (1.1627296528817612 in cost); and be non-intrusive 12.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps, and very-intrusive 1.0 step (0.9999999999999999 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission140\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 1.1999999999973845 collisions (-0.02000000000026153 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 158.65565157078035 minutes (+0.04402236819835559 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission140\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 1.0 collision (-0.03999999999999998 in cost), and reduce the time to 150.950449280701 minutes (-0.014584232602348646 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to non-intrusive 10.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 0.0 step, and very-intrusive 2.0 steps (+0.20000000000000007 in cost). The decrease in collision, and the decrease in time are not worth the increase in intrusiveness.","Mission":"mission140.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission140\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission140\/altPolicy2.json"]}
