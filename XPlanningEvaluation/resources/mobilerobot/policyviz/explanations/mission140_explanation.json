{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission140\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission140\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.0 collision (0.3 in cost); take 123.38347157236265 minutes (1.7553253743354373 in cost); and be non-intrusive 4.0 steps, very-intrusive 3.0000000000000004 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 6.000000000000001 steps (1.0 in cost). It has the lowest expected time, and intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission140\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.9199999999996086 collision (-0.024000000000117427 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 125.80180727575863 minutes (+0.03440465703984308 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission140.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission140\/altPolicy1.json"]}
