{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission141\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission141\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.4000000000000001 collisions (0.14 in cost); take 135.9787816394753 minutes (0.7738054465196408 in cost); and be very-intrusive 2.0 steps, non-intrusive 6.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 6.0 steps (2.8 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission141\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 1.2 collisions (-0.020000000000000018 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 143.05754698823 minutes (+0.04028266112887946 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission141\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 0.8 collision (-0.06 in cost), and reduce the time to 130.46223692108998 minutes (-0.031392635656741885 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to very-intrusive 3.0 steps, non-intrusive 4.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 6.0 steps (+0.6999999999999993 in cost). The decrease in collision, and the decrease in time are not worth the increase in intrusiveness.","Mission":"mission141.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission141\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission141\/altPolicy2.json"]}
