{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission141\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission141\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.0 collision (0.0 in cost); take 178.65541206668777 minutes (0.36236596251716474 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 5.0 steps, non-intrusive 7.0 steps, and very-intrusive 0.0 step (1.1666666666666665 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness, and collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission141\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 169.59994707446 minutes (-0.01836715859872312 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.2 collision (+0.04000000000000001 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission141.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission141\/altPolicy1.json"]}
