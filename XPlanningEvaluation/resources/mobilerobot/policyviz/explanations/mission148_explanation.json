It is expected to have 0.4 collision (0.2 in cost); take 142.55391543802608 minutes (1.6224442498846692 in cost); and be non-intrusive 4.0 steps, very-intrusive 3.0000000000000004 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 6.000000000000001 steps (0.5 in cost).\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission148\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.36000000000000004 collision (-0.01999999999999999 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 145.27960957805 minutes (+0.031021854228540535 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission148\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the time to 140.1355797346871 minutes (-0.02752372563122507 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.48000000000001664 collision (+0.04000000000000831 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission148\/altPolicy3.json] would reduce the intrusiveness to non-intrusive 4.749997435813889 steps, very-intrusive 2.8333323059200004 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 5.999996289024001 steps (-0.016666666666666607 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 155.87441274285086 minutes (+0.1516041435369253 in cost), and increase the collision to 0.4083333333333334 collision (+0.00416666666666668 in cost). The decrease in intrusiveness is not worth the increase in time, and the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission148.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission148\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission148\/altPolicy2.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission148\/altPolicy3.json"]}
