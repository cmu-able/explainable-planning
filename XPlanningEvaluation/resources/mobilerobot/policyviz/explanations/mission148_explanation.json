{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission148\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission148\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.4 collision (0.2 in cost); take 142.55391543802605 minutes (1.6224442498846692 in cost); and be very-intrusive 3.0 steps, non-intrusive 4.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 6.0 steps (0.5 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission148\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 135.4751500892924 minutes (-0.08056532225752022 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.6000000000000633 collision (+0.10000000000003162 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission148\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 0.2000000000000958 collision (-0.09999999999995211 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 153.06922976134314 minutes (+0.11967760553734208 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission148.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission148\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission148\/altPolicy2.json"]}
