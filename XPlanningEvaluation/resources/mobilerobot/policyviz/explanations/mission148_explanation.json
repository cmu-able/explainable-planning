{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission148\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission148\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.4 collision (0.2 in cost); take 142.55391543802608 minutes (1.6224442498846692 in cost); and be non-intrusive 4.0 steps, very-intrusive 3.0000000000000004 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 6.000000000000001 steps (0.5 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission148\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 140.13557973468596 minutes (-0.02752372563123795 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.4800000000000222 collision (+0.04000000000001108 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission148\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 0.3599999999996991 collision (-0.020000000000150453 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 145.27960957793323 minutes (+0.03102185422721182 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission148.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission148\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission148\/altPolicy2.json"]}
