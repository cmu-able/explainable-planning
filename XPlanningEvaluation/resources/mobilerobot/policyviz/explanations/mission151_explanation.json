{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission151\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission151\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.0 collision (0.0 in cost); take 195.28912994158196 minutes (0.5756515263794328 in cost); and be non-intrusive 8.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps, and very-intrusive 3.0000000000000004 steps (0.7333333333333335 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness, and collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission151\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 178.47063473088002 minutes (-0.04957568525366385 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to non-intrusive 8.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 3.0 steps, and very-intrusive 3.0 steps (+0.06666666666666654 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in intrusiveness.","Mission":"mission151.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission151\/altPolicy1.json"]}
