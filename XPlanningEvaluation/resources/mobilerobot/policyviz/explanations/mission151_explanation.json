{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission151\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission151\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.0 collision (0.0 in cost); take 169.79901613657478 minutes (1.2915096554805896 in cost); and be non-intrusive 6.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 5.0 steps, and very-intrusive 1.0 step (0.7999999999999999 in cost). It has the lowest expected collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission151\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 160.4280402966231 minutes (-0.07127665432901198 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.20000000000012783 collision (+0.08000000000005114 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission151\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the intrusiveness to non-intrusive 10.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 4.0 steps, and very-intrusive 1.0 step (-0.10000001816888915 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.3999999896177777 collision (+0.1599999958471111 in cost), and increase the time to 179.36444955173 minutes (+0.0727557196479458 in cost). The decrease in intrusiveness is not worth the increase in collision, and the increase in time.","Mission":"mission151.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission151\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission151\/altPolicy2.json"]}
