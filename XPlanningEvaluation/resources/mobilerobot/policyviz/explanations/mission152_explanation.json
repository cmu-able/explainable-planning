{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission152\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission152\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.7999999999999998 collisions (0.36 in cost); take 160.82686632081064 minutes (1.4033423063758643 in cost); and be very-intrusive 0.0 step, somewhat-intrusive 4.0 steps, and non-intrusive 11.0 steps (0.6666666666666666 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission152\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 1.6 collisions (-0.039999999999999925 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 167.90563166951998 minutes (+0.06176785706273469 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission152\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 1.4 collisions (-0.08000000000000002 in cost), and reduce the time to 153.08873739319995 minutes (-0.06752132864819549 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to very-intrusive 0.0 step, somewhat-intrusive 5.0 steps, and non-intrusive 10.0 steps (+0.16666666666666663 in cost). The decrease in collision, and the decrease in time are not worth the increase in intrusiveness.","Mission":"mission152.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission152\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission152\/altPolicy2.json"]}
