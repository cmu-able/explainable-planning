{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission152\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission152\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.0 collision (0.3 in cost); take 147.22719265641655 minutes (1.2567240511323112 in cost); and be non-intrusive 6.0 steps, very-intrusive 2.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 6.000000000000001 steps (1.6 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission152\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.9600000000000001 collision (-0.011999999999999955 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 149.80659359837003 minutes (+0.022017639151968194 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission152\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the time to 145.23913336653334 minutes (-0.016969975991485642 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 1.111999999998852 collisions (+0.03359999999965557 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission152.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission152\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission152\/altPolicy2.json"]}
