{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission152\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission152\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.0 collision (0.3 in cost); take 147.22719265641652 minutes (1.2567240511323112 in cost); and be very-intrusive 2.0 steps, non-intrusive 6.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 6.0 steps (1.6 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission152\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.8 collision (-0.06 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 154.30595800512998 minutes (+0.060423991692967416 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission152\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the time to 143.05754698823 minutes (-0.03559188965953086 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 1.2 collisions (+0.06 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission152.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission152\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission152\/altPolicy2.json"]}
