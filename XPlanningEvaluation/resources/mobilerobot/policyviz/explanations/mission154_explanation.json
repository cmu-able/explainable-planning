{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission154\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission154\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.0 collision (0.1 in cost); take 129.58652555014822 minutes (1.31419881203225 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 5.0 steps, non-intrusive 7.0 steps, and very-intrusive 0.0 step (0.6666666666666666 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission154\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 126.73329213843824 minutes (-0.02893600198169488 in cost), and reduce the collision to 0.6000000000001823 collision (-0.03999999999998177 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to somewhat-intrusive 6.0 steps, non-intrusive 8.0 steps, and very-intrusive 0.0 step (+0.1333333333336908 in cost). The decrease in time, and the decrease in collision are not worth the increase in intrusiveness.","Mission":"mission154.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission154\/altPolicy1.json"]}
