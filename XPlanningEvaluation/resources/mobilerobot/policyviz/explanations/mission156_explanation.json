{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission156\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission156\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.0 collision (0.0 in cost); take 157.303986454379 minutes (0.4636831549975175 in cost); and be non-intrusive 7.0 steps, very-intrusive 2.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 4.0 steps (2.0000000000000004 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness, and collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission156\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 143.67551575469 minutes (-0.04017248662452505 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.2 collision (+0.06 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission156.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission156\/altPolicy1.json"]}
