{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission158\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission158\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.6 collision (0.12 in cost); take 138.8625899807392 minutes (0.6731591823310811 in cost); and be very-intrusive 1.0 step, non-intrusive 6.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 5.0 steps (1.5999999999999999 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission158\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.3999999999984136 collision (-0.04000000000031727 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 148.33347870388468 minutes (+0.045911686579557354 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission158\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the time to 136.20607875474246 minutes (-0.012877873911132931 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.7999999999994382 collision (+0.03999999999988765 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission158.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission158\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission158\/altPolicy2.json"]}
