{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission160\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission160\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.4 collision (0.2 in cost); take 156.64439837711794 minutes (1.827517981066376 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 6.000000000000001 steps, very-intrusive 0.0 step, and non-intrusive 7.0 steps (0.19999999999999996 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission160\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 155.07704486409062 minutes (-0.018285790985318684 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.5199999999999974 collision (+0.059999999999998666 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission160\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 0.35999999999972787 collision (-0.020000000000136076 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 158.5790669391293 minutes (+0.022571133223467044 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission160.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission160\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission160\/altPolicy2.json"]}
