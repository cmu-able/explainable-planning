{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission160\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission160\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.4 collision (0.2 in cost); take 156.64439837711785 minutes (1.8275179810663755 in cost); and be very-intrusive 0.0 step, non-intrusive 7.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 6.0 steps (0.19999999999999998 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission160\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.19999999999985132 collision (-0.10000000000007435 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 166.31774119048475 minutes (+0.11285566615594744 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission160\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the time to 149.30639289795002 minutes (-0.08561006392362502 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.6000000000000001 collision (+0.10000000000000003 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission160.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission160\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission160\/altPolicy2.json"]}
