{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission162\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission162\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.2 collision (0.08000000000000002 in cost); take 168.48605499515904 minutes (1.4899332301899042 in cost); and be non-intrusive 8.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 3.0 steps, and very-intrusive 3.0 steps (1.2 in cost).\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission162\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the intrusiveness to non-intrusive 8.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps, and very-intrusive 3.0000000000000004 steps (-0.10000000001134612 in cost), and reduce the time to 165.1158930678778 minutes (-0.029802562869202687 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.5999999999967263 collision (+0.1599999999986905 in cost). The decrease in intrusiveness, and the decrease in time are not worth the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission162\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the intrusiveness to non-intrusive 8.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps, and very-intrusive 3.0000000000000004 steps (-0.09999999999999964 in cost), and reduce the collision to 0.16000000000000003 collision (-0.016 in cost).
