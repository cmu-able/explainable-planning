{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission162\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission162\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.2 collision (0.08000000000000002 in cost); take 168.48605499515904 minutes (1.4899332301899042 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 3.0 steps, very-intrusive 3.0 steps, and non-intrusive 8.0 steps (1.2 in cost).\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission162\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 165.11589306905327 minutes (-0.02980256285880878 in cost), and reduce the intrusiveness to somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps, very-intrusive 3.0 steps, and non-intrusive 8.0 steps (-0.09999999999847464 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.6000000000011252 collision (+0.16000000000045006 in cost). The decrease in time, and the decrease in intrusiveness are not worth the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission162\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 0.0 collision (-0.08000000000000002 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 178.47063473078697 minutes (+0.08829429318658 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission162.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission162\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission162\/altPolicy2.json"]}
