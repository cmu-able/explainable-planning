{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission163\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission163\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.2 collisions (0.36 in cost); take 125.58897208709811 minutes (1.0989035057621088 in cost); and be very-intrusive 0.0 step, non-intrusive 7.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 6.0 steps (0.7999999999999999 in cost). It has the lowest expected time, and intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission163\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.9999999999986372 collision (-0.06000000000040884 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 132.6677374356703 minutes (+0.06193919680000648 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission163.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission163\/altPolicy1.json"]}
