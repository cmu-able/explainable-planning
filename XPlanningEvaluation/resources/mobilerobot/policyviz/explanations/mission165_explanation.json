{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission165\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission165\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.5999999999999999 collisions (0.32 in cost); take 133.0352840001666 minutes (1.6864678971168694 in cost); and be non-intrusive 10.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 0.0 step, and very-intrusive 2.0 steps (0.6 in cost).\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission165\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 1.4000000000000001 collisions (-0.03999999999999998 in cost), and reduce the intrusiveness to non-intrusive 12.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps, and very-intrusive 1.0 step (-0.09999999999990106 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 152.86788624035438 minutes (+0.25141485768785166 in cost). The decrease in collision, and the decrease in intrusiveness are not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission165\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 1.4 collisions (-0.040000000000000036 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 138.82304933129 minutes (+0.07337061367098197 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission165\/altPolicy3.json] would reduce the collision to 1.2000000000015179 collisions (-0.07999999999969643 in cost), and reduce the time to 128.5889107743664 minutes (-0.05636599162597067 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to non-intrusive 6.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 5.0 steps, and very-intrusive 1.0 step (+0.20000000000055673 in cost). The decrease in collision, and the decrease in time are not worth the increase in intrusiveness.","Mission":"mission165.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission165\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission165\/altPolicy2.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission165\/altPolicy3.json"]}
