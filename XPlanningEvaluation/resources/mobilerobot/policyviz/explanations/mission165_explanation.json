{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission165\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission165\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.2000000000000002 collisions (0.12000000000000002 in cost); take 122.8744324800781 minutes (2.897564432032537 in cost); and be non-intrusive 5.0 steps, very-intrusive 6.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps (0.6666666666666666 in cost). It has the lowest expected time, and intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission165\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 1.159999999999934 collisions (-0.004000000000006623 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 124.76861022488293 minutes (+0.044667567943264874 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission165.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission165\/altPolicy1.json"]}
