{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission166\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission166\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.6000000000000001 collision (0.06000000000000001 in cost); take 149.82557845755505 minutes (0.4416391375985582 in cost); and be non-intrusive 7.0 steps, very-intrusive 5.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps (4.533333333333333 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission166\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.5599999999999771 collision (-0.0040000000000023 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 151.7197562022776 minutes (+0.005583445992665692 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission166\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the time to 148.13235748036084 minutes (-0.004991088036037095 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.7599999999994063 collision (+0.015999999999940617 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission166.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission166\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission166\/altPolicy2.json"]}
