{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission168\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission168\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.4 collisions (0.27999999999999997 in cost); take 131.34246077690926 minutes (1.5486266552014554 in cost); and be non-intrusive 7.0 steps, very-intrusive 5.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps (2.2666666666666666 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission168\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 1.3599999999973233 collisions (-0.008000000000535301 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 133.23663852141536 minutes (+0.02233378396810992 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission168\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 1.2800000000000002 collisions (-0.02399999999999991 in cost), and reduce the time to 129.84942720298199 minutes (-0.017603991702437538 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to non-intrusive 6.2 steps, very-intrusive 5.4 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps (+0.1600000000000006 in cost). The decrease in collision, and the decrease in time are not worth the increase in intrusiveness.","Mission":"mission168.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission168\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission168\/altPolicy2.json"]}
