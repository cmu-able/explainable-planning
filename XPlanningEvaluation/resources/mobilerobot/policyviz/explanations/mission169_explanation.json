{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission169\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission169\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.8 collisions (0.18000000000000002 in cost); take 130.9884194682227 minutes (2.7027914220943807 in cost); and be non-intrusive 8.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps, and very-intrusive 3.0000000000000004 steps (0.7333333333333335 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness, and time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission169\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 1.7600000000000002 collisions (-0.003999999999999976 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 132.923088031 minutes (+0.03991960218543422 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission169.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission169\/altPolicy1.json"]}
