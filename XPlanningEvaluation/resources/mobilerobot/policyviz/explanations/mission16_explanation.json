{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission16\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission16\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.6000000000000001 collision (0.18000000000000002 in cost); take 120.1560520945188 minutes (2.1250956920938835 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 4.0 steps, very-intrusive 2.0 steps, and non-intrusive 7.0 steps (0.3333333333333335 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness, and time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission16\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.5600000000002165 collision (-0.011999999999935063 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 122.9252762639188 minutes (+0.048976861758114776 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission16.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission16\/altPolicy1.json"]}
