{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission172\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission172\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.4 collisions (0.27999999999999997 in cost); take 139.8368761540718 minutes (1.2365866634712763 in cost); and be non-intrusive 8.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps, and very-intrusive 3.0000000000000004 steps (1.8333333333333337 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission172\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 1.3600000000000003 collisions (-0.007999999999999896 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 141.77154471688002 minutes (+0.017108400936888257 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission172\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the time to 138.25761649837852 minutes (-0.013965496670826694 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 1.6432000000000002 collisions (+0.04864000000000007 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission172.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission172\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission172\/altPolicy2.json"]}
