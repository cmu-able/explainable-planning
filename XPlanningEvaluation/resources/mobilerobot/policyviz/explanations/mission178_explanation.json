{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission178\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission178\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.4 collision (0.2 in cost); take 144.84891678751345 minutes (1.7078779565064843 in cost); and be non-intrusive 5.0 steps, very-intrusive 6.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps (0.6666666666666666 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission178\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 143.18754531259003 minutes (-0.01958882249532201 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.5199999999998585 collision (+0.05999999999992922 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission178\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 0.35999999999954 collision (-0.02000000000023 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 146.743094532233 minutes (+0.022333783970627463 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission178.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission178\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission178\/altPolicy2.json"]}
