{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission178\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission178\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.4 collision (0.2 in cost); take 144.84891678751342 minutes (1.7078779565064843 in cost); and be non-intrusive 5.0 steps, very-intrusive 6.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps (0.6666666666666666 in cost).\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission178\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 137.1879044926247 minutes (-0.0903291119681573 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.6000000000001382 collision (+0.10000000000006909 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission178\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the intrusiveness to non-intrusive 7.0 steps, very-intrusive 5.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps (-0.099999999998726 in cost), and reduce the collision to 0.2000000000000115 collision (-0.09999999999999426 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 164.56535610166628 minutes (+0.23247168727424206 in cost). The decrease in intrusiveness, and the decrease in collision are not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission178.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission178\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission178\/altPolicy2.json"]}
