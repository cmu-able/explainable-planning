{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission17\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission17\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.4 collision (0.16000000000000003 in cost); take 134.07883924894114 minutes (1.3597575095987275 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 6.0 steps, non-intrusive 8.0 steps, and very-intrusive 0.0 step (0.19999999999999998 in cost).\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission17\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.1999999999992518 collision (-0.0800000000002993 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 143.13430424088276 minutes (+0.09183579299071432 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission17\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the intrusiveness to somewhat-intrusive 5.0 steps, non-intrusive 7.0 steps, and very-intrusive 0.0 step (-0.0333333333335156 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 144.56131546582196 minutes (+0.10630779498791276 in cost), and increase the collision to 0.5999999999991941 collision (+0.0799999999996776 in cost). The decrease in intrusiveness is not worth the increase in time, and the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission17\/altPolicy3.json] would reduce the time to 131.59734089141 minutes (-0.025166059354414516 in cost).

The decrease in time is not worth the increase in intrusiveness.","Mission":"mission17.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission17\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission17\/altPolicy2.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission17\/altPolicy3.json"]}
