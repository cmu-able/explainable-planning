{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission18\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission18\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.4 collisions (0.13999999999999999 in cost); take 131.34246077690926 minutes (1.935783319001819 in cost); and be non-intrusive 7.0 steps, very-intrusive 5.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps (2.2666666666666666 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission18\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 1.2799999999990055 collisions (-0.012000000000099431 in cost), and reduce the time to 129.84942720285957 minutes (-0.022004989629851313 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to non-intrusive 6.2 steps, very-intrusive 5.4 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps (+0.15999999999821402 in cost). The decrease in collision, and the decrease in time are not worth the increase in intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission18\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 1.3599999999971257 collisions (-0.0040000000002874125 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 133.2366385213922 minutes (+0.027917229959796286 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission18.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission18\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission18\/altPolicy2.json"]}
