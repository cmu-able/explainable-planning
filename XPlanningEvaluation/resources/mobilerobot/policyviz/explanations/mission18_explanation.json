{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission18\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission18\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.6000000000000001 collision (0.18000000000000002 in cost); take 138.8625899807392 minutes (1.0097387734966214 in cost); and be very-intrusive 1.0 step, non-intrusive 6.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 5.0 steps (1.0666666666666667 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission18\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 136.20607875486002 minutes (-0.019316810865844358 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.8 collision (+0.05999999999999997 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission18\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 0.39999999999841657 collision (-0.06000000000047506 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 148.3334787038854 minutes (+0.0688675298693413 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission18.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission18\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission18\/altPolicy2.json"]}
