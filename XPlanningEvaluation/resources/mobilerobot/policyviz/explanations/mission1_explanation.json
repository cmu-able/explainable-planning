{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission1\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission1\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.0 collision (0.0 in cost); take 195.0797118102451 minutes (1.1101271954655236 in cost); and be non-intrusive 6.0 steps, very-intrusive 2.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 6.000000000000001 steps (0.8 in cost). It has the lowest expected collision, and intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission1\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 192.3540176703721 minutes (-0.015510927113411732 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.040000000000000153 collision (+0.02400000000000009 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission1.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission1\/altPolicy1.json"]}
