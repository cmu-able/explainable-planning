{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission20\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission20\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.0 collision (0.3 in cost); take 126.2135904358939 minutes (2.202627896075185 in cost); and be very-intrusive 0.0 step, somewhat-intrusive 7.0 steps, and non-intrusive 5.0 steps (0.2333333333333333 in cost).\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission20\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the intrusiveness to very-intrusive 0.0 step, somewhat-intrusive 6.0 steps, and non-intrusive 6.0 steps (-0.03333333333330532 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 1.399999999999865 collisions (+0.11999999999995947 in cost), and increase the time to 133.95171936351673 minutes (+0.13504265729660414 in cost). The decrease in intrusiveness is not worth the increase in collision, and the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission20\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the time to 124.83171368191333 minutes (-0.024115947234710777 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to very-intrusive 3.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 5.0 steps, and non-intrusive 5.0 steps (+0.23333333333752268 in cost), and increase the collision to 1.6000000000076193 collisions (+0.18000000000228578 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in intrusiveness, and the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission20\/altPolicy3.json] would reduce the collision to 0.6000000000000997 collision (-0.1199999999999701 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 137.23669967962942 minutes (+0.19237078858055545 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission20.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission20\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission20\/altPolicy2.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission20\/altPolicy3.json"]}
