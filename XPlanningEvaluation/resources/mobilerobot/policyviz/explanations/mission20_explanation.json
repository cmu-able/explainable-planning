{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission20\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission20\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.7999999999999998 collisions (0.18 in cost); take 130.98841946822267 minutes (1.544452241196789 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps, very-intrusive 3.0 steps, and non-intrusive 8.0 steps (1.8333333333333335 in cost). It has the lowest expected time, and intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission20\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 1.4 collisions (-0.04000000000000001 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 139.83687615415997 minutes (+0.10432997676595335 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission20.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission20\/altPolicy1.json"]}
