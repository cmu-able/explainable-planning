{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission21\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission21\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.0 collision (0.0 in cost); take 166.69770046132672 minutes (0.948615563281583 in cost); and be non-intrusive 4.0 steps, very-intrusive 3.0000000000000004 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 6.000000000000001 steps (0.5 in cost). It has the lowest expected collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission21\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 163.97200632143 minutes (-0.015510927113546402 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.04000000000000001 collision (+0.028000000000000004 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission21\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the intrusiveness to non-intrusive 4.749999487123456 steps, very-intrusive 2.8333323878400005 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 5.999998917017601 steps (-0.016666666666666663 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 181.40721763577753 minutes (+0.08370647514288276 in cost), and increase the collision to 0.07500000000000001 collision (+0.052500000000000005 in cost). The decrease in intrusiveness is not worth the increase in time, and the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission21.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission21\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission21\/altPolicy2.json"]}
