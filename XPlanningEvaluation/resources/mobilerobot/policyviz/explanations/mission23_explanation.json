{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission23\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission23\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.0 collision (0.2 in cost); take 147.22719265641655 minutes (0.8378160340882076 in cost); and be non-intrusive 6.0 steps, very-intrusive 2.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 6.000000000000001 steps (2.4 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission23\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 145.2391333664997 minutes (-0.011313317327848571 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 1.111999999998682 collisions (+0.02239999999973641 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission23\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 0.9600000000000001 collision (-0.00799999999999998 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 149.80659359837003 minutes (+0.014678426101312092 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission23.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission23\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission23\/altPolicy2.json"]}
