{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission23\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission23\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.0 collision (0.2 in cost); take 147.22719265641652 minutes (0.8378160340882076 in cost); and be very-intrusive 2.0 steps, non-intrusive 6.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 6.0 steps (2.4 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission23\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 143.057546988225 minutes (-0.023727926439715774 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 1.1999999999999555 collisions (+0.0399999999999911 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission23\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 0.8 collision (-0.03999999999999998 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 154.30595800512998 minutes (+0.04028266112864487 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission23.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission23\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission23\/altPolicy2.json"]}
