{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission24\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission24\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.2000000000000002 collisions (0.36000000000000004 in cost); take 122.8744324800781 minutes (2.173173324024402 in cost); and be non-intrusive 5.0 steps, very-intrusive 6.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps (0.6666666666666666 in cost). It has the lowest expected time, and intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission24\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 1.159999999997183 collisions (-0.012000000000845112 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 124.76861022451607 minutes (+0.03350067595096062 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission24.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission24\/altPolicy1.json"]}
