{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission24\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission24\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.2000000000000002 collisions (0.36000000000000004 in cost); take 122.8744324800781 minutes (2.173173324024402 in cost); and be non-intrusive 5.0 steps, very-intrusive 6.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps (0.6666666666666666 in cost). It has the lowest expected time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission24\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the intrusiveness to non-intrusive 7.0 steps, very-intrusive 5.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps (-0.09999999999921971 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 131.34246077717955 minutes (+0.14976665878256057 in cost), and increase the collision to 1.400000000000992 collisions (+0.06000000000029754 in cost). The decrease in intrusiveness is not worth the increase in time, and the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission24\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 0.999999999999749 collision (-0.06000000000007538 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 129.95319782882032 minutes (+0.12519597211900946 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission24.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission24\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission24\/altPolicy2.json"]}
