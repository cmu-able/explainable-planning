{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission25\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission25\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.4 collisions (0.13999999999999999 in cost); take 131.3424607769093 minutes (0.7743133276007277 in cost); and be non-intrusive 7.0 steps, very-intrusive 5.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps (3.966666666666666 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission25\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 129.95319782878605 minutes (-0.008190228886459372 in cost), and reduce the collision to 0.9999999999995322 collision (-0.04000000000004676 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to non-intrusive 5.0 steps, very-intrusive 6.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps (+0.6999999999981315 in cost). The decrease in time, and the decrease in collision are not worth the increase in intrusiveness.","Mission":"mission25.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission25\/altPolicy1.json"]}
