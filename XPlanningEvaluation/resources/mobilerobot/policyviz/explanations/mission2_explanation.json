{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission2\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission2\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.4 collision (0.2 in cost); take 158.80278690314347 minutes (1.2883958915296838 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 1.0 step, very-intrusive 3.0 steps, and non-intrusive 8.0 steps (0.33333333333333337 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission2\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.20000000000008958 collision (-0.09999999999995522 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 172.64890774992827 minutes (+0.11233609661713029 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission2\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the time to 148.2874725793905 minutes (-0.0853126575236347 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.5999999999991004 collision (+0.09999999999955017 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission2.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission2\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission2\/altPolicy2.json"]}
