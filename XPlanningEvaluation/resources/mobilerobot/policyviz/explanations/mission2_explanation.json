{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission2\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission2\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.0 collision (0.3 in cost); take 123.38347157236265 minutes (2.1063904492025247 in cost); and be non-intrusive 4.0 steps, very-intrusive 3.0000000000000004 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 6.000000000000001 steps (0.5 in cost). It has the lowest expected time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission2\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.9200000000000002 collision (-0.023999999999999966 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 125.80180727581 minutes (+0.04128558844868824 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission2\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the intrusiveness to non-intrusive 4.7499994660864004 steps, very-intrusive 2.8333323059200004 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 5.999997992960001 steps (-0.016666666666666663 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 134.00186512855416 minutes (+0.18127616679611647 in cost), and increase the collision to 1.075 collisions (+0.022499999999999964 in cost). The decrease in intrusiveness is not worth the increase in time, and the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission2.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission2\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission2\/altPolicy2.json"]}
