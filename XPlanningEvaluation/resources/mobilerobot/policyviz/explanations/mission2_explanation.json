{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission2\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission2\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.0 collision (0.3 in cost); take 123.38347157236262 minutes (2.1063904492025247 in cost); and be very-intrusive 3.0 steps, non-intrusive 4.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 6.0 steps (0.5 in cost). It has the lowest expected time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission2\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the intrusiveness to very-intrusive 2.0 steps, non-intrusive 6.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 6.0 steps (-0.09999999999959142 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 1.400000000002053 collisions (+0.12000000000061589 in cost), and increase the time to 135.97878163969364 minutes (+0.21502589036012498 in cost). The decrease in intrusiveness is not worth the increase in collision, and the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission2\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 0.8 collision (-0.06 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 130.46223692108998 minutes (+0.12084798338617153 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission2.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission2\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission2\/altPolicy2.json"]}
