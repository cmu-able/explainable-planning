It is expected to have 1.0 collision (0.4 in cost); take 126.2135904358939 minutes (1.8355232467293208 in cost); and be very-intrusive 0.0 step, somewhat-intrusive 7.0 steps, and non-intrusive 5.0 steps (0.2333333333333333 in cost).\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission30\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.6000000000000997 collision (-0.15999999999996015 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 137.23669967962942 minutes (+0.1603089904837962 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission30\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the time to 124.83171368191333 minutes (-0.020096622695592314 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to very-intrusive 3.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 5.0 steps, and non-intrusive 5.0 steps (+0.23333333333752268 in cost), and increase the collision to 1.6000000000076193 collisions (+0.24000000000304778 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in intrusiveness, and the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission30\/altPolicy3.json] would reduce the intrusiveness to very-intrusive 0.0 step, somewhat-intrusive 6.0 steps, and non-intrusive 6.0 steps (-0.033333333333333326 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 1.4 collisions (+0.15999999999999992 in cost), and increase the time to 133.95171936353 minutes (+0.11253554774736374 in cost). The decrease in intrusiveness is not worth the increase in collision, and the increase in time.","Mission":"mission30.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission30\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission30\/altPolicy2.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission30\/altPolicy3.json"]}
