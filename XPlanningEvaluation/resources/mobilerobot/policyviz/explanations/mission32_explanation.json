{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission32\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission32\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.0 collision (0.0 in cost); take 216.96739123768566 minutes (1.100184940539818 in cost); and be non-intrusive 12.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps, and very-intrusive 1.0 step (0.49999999999999994 in cost). It has the lowest expected collision, and intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission32\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 212.5593146846221 minutes (-0.022352204231070205 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.19999999999997572 collision (+0.09999999999998786 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission32.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission32\/altPolicy1.json"]}
