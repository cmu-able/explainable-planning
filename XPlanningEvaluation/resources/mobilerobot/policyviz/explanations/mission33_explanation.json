{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission33\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission33\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.4 collision (0.12 in cost); take 189.88659697662123 minutes (0.9628653099081289 in cost); and be non-intrusive 12.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps, and very-intrusive 1.0 step (0.8333333333333333 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission33\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 184.69300729231642 minutes (-0.026335336040223423 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.5999999999998487 collision (+0.05999999999995459 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission33\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 0.1999999999997083 collision (-0.06000000000008751 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 203.0574354660025 minutes (+0.06678588002390395 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission33.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission33\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission33\/altPolicy2.json"]}
