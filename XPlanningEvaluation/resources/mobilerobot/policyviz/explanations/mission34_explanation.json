{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission34\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission34\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.6000000000000001 collision (0.12000000000000002 in cost); take 120.1560520945188 minutes (0.7083652306979613 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 4.0 steps, very-intrusive 2.0 steps, and non-intrusive 7.0 steps (2.0000000000000004 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness, and time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission34\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.56 collision (-0.008000000000000007 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 122.92527626389004 minutes (+0.016325620585868617 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission34.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission34\/altPolicy1.json"]}
