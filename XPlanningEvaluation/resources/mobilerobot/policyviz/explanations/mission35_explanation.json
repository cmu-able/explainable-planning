{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission35\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission35\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.0 collision (0.0 in cost); take 169.79901613657478 minutes (1.7220128739741196 in cost); and be non-intrusive 6.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 5.0 steps, and very-intrusive 1.0 step (0.26666666666666666 in cost). It has the lowest expected collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission35\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the intrusiveness to non-intrusive 10.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 4.0 steps, and very-intrusive 1.0 step (-0.033333333333333354 in cost), and reduce the time to 169.07939494864 minutes (-0.007298021968581647 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.6000000000000001 collision (+0.30000000000000004 in cost). The decrease in intrusiveness, and the decrease in time are not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission35.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission35\/altPolicy1.json"]}
