{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission35\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission35\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.0 collision (0.0 in cost); take 157.303986454379 minutes (0.927366309995035 in cost); and be non-intrusive 7.0 steps, very-intrusive 2.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 4.0 steps (0.3333333333333334 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness, and collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission35\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 143.67551575469 minutes (-0.0803449732490501 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.2 collision (+0.13999999999999999 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission35.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission35\/altPolicy1.json"]}
