{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission35\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission35\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.0 collision (0.0 in cost); take 157.30398645437901 minutes (0.927366309995035 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 4.0 steps, very-intrusive 2.0 steps, and non-intrusive 7.0 steps (0.3333333333333335 in cost). It has the lowest expected collision, and intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission35\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 154.534762285192 minutes (-0.01632562058478282 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.04000000000000057 collision (+0.028000000000000396 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission35.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission35\/altPolicy1.json"]}
