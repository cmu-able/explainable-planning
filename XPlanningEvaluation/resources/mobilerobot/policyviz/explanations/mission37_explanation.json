{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission37\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission37\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.0 collision (0.0 in cost); take 218.04737565191465 minutes (0.6342122516523997 in cost); and be very-intrusive 0.0 step, somewhat-intrusive 4.0 steps, and non-intrusive 11.0 steps (0.39999999999999997 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness, and collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission37\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 195.36626580227997 minutes (-0.06597024020447495 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to very-intrusive 0.0 step, somewhat-intrusive 5.0 steps, and non-intrusive 10.0 steps (+0.09999999999999998 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in intrusiveness.","Mission":"mission37.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission37\/altPolicy1.json"]}
