{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission37\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission37\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.4 collisions (0.42 in cost); take 139.8368761540718 minutes (1.648782217961702 in cost); and be non-intrusive 8.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps, and very-intrusive 3.0000000000000004 steps (1.1 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission37\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 138.2576164983711 minutes (-0.01862066222785619 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 1.6431999999998372 collisions (+0.07295999999995118 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission37\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 1.3600000000000003 collisions (-0.0119999999999999 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 141.77154471688002 minutes (+0.02281120124918412 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission37.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission37\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission37\/altPolicy2.json"]}
