{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission38\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission38\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.8 collision (0.24 in cost); take 170.7830515205403 minutes (1.2989943348894728 in cost); and be non-intrusive 12.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps, and very-intrusive 1.0 step (0.6666666666666666 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission38\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.6000000000001258 collision (-0.05999999999996228 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 179.60153891556973 minutes (+0.06707436754671003 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission38\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the time to 167.47413896619 minutes (-0.025167946259754048 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 1.0 collision (+0.06 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission38.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission38\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission38\/altPolicy2.json"]}
