{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission40\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission40\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.2 collisions (0.48 in cost); take 125.58897208709814 minutes (1.8315058429368483 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 6.000000000000001 steps, very-intrusive 0.0 step, and non-intrusive 7.0 steps (0.19999999999999996 in cost). It has the lowest expected time, and intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission40\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 1.1599999999979287 collisions (-0.016000000000828463 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 127.00472515667093 minutes (+0.020646398931269738 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission40.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission40\/altPolicy1.json"]}
