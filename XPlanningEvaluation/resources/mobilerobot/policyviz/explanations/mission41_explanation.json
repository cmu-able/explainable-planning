{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission41\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission41\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.0 collision (0.0 in cost); take 178.65541206668777 minutes (0.36236596251716474 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 5.0 steps, non-intrusive 7.0 steps, and very-intrusive 0.0 step (0.3333333333333333 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness, and collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission41\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 152.6051929647437 minutes (-0.05283754132864088 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to somewhat-intrusive 6.0 steps, non-intrusive 8.0 steps, and very-intrusive 0.0 step (+0.06666666666697402 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in intrusiveness.","Mission":"mission41.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission41\/altPolicy1.json"]}
