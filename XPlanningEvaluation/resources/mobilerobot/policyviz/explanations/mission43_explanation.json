{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission43\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission43\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.0 collision (0.0 in cost); take 174.0362448246809 minutes (1.0260092818134934 in cost); and be non-intrusive 7.0 steps, very-intrusive 5.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps (0.5666666666666667 in cost). It has the lowest expected collision, and intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission43\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 172.14206708005062 minutes (-0.011166891984787153 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.03999999999999 collision (+0.027999999999993 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission43.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission43\/altPolicy1.json"]}
