{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission48\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission48\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.4000000000000001 collision (0.20000000000000004 in cost); take 129.8293949081061 minutes (1.148089850727368 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 4.0 steps, very-intrusive 2.0 steps, and non-intrusive 7.0 steps (0.666666666666667 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission48\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 125.9726614079944 minutes (-0.034105347187149526 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.552 collision (+0.07599999999999998 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission48\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 0.3599999999985398 collision (-0.020000000000730128 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 132.5986190771083 minutes (+0.024488430875539757 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission48.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission48\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission48\/altPolicy2.json"]}
