{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission48\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission48\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.4 collision (0.2 in cost); take 129.8293949081061 minutes (1.1480898507273678 in cost); and be non-intrusive 7.0 steps, very-intrusive 2.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 4.0 steps (0.6666666666666669 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission48\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 120.15605209464402 minutes (-0.08554200467931894 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.6000000000004421 collision (+0.10000000000022102 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission48\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 0.19999999999974116 collision (-0.10000000000012943 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 143.45786560794372 minutes (+0.12051745987488904 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission48.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission48\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission48\/altPolicy2.json"]}
