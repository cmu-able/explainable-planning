{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission50\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission50\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.6000000000000001 collision (0.06000000000000001 in cost); take 120.15605209451877 minutes (0.7083652306979611 in cost); and be non-intrusive 7.0 steps, very-intrusive 2.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 4.0 steps (2.3333333333333335 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness, and time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission50\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.39999999999896585 collision (-0.02000000000010342 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 129.82939490774064 minutes (+0.05702800311812939 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission50.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission50\/altPolicy1.json"]}
