{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission51\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission51\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.4 collisions (0.13999999999999999 in cost); take 131.34246077690926 minutes (1.5486266552014554 in cost); and be non-intrusive 7.0 steps, very-intrusive 5.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps (2.833333333333333 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission51\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 1.35999999999737 collisions (-0.004000000000262988 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 133.2366385214194 minutes (+0.022333783968158105 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission51\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 1.2799999999994878 collisions (-0.012000000000051192 in cost), and reduce the time to 129.84942720293571 minutes (-0.017603991702983324 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to non-intrusive 6.2 steps, very-intrusive 5.4 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps (+0.19999999999983142 in cost). The decrease in collision, and the decrease in time are not worth the increase in intrusiveness.","Mission":"mission51.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission51\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission51\/altPolicy2.json"]}
