{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission52\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission52\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.8000000000000002 collision (0.32000000000000006 in cost); take 130.10913914378267 minutes (1.9176060789055964 in cost); and be non-intrusive 5.0 steps, very-intrusive 6.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps (0.6666666666666666 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission52\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.7600000000000001 collision (-0.016000000000000014 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 132.00331688856 minutes (+0.027917229964135926 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission52\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the time to 128.5722244671939 minutes (-0.022651728740813892 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 1.1199999999999413 collisions (+0.12799999999997647 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission52.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission52\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission52\/altPolicy2.json"]}
