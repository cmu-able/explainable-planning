{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission52\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission52\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.8 collision (0.32000000000000006 in cost); take 130.10913914378267 minutes (1.9176060789055964 in cost); and be non-intrusive 5.0 steps, very-intrusive 6.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps (0.6666666666666666 in cost).\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission52\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 122.87443248027012 minutes (-0.10662830888243091 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 1.2000000000002802 collisions (+0.16000000000011205 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission52\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the intrusiveness to non-intrusive 7.0 steps, very-intrusive 5.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps (-0.09999999999999987 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 138.57716744069998 minutes (+0.12480554898275376 in cost), and increase the collision to 1.0 collision (+0.07999999999999996 in cost). The decrease in intrusiveness is not worth the increase in time, and the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission52\/altPolicy3.json] would reduce the collision to 0.6000000000000001 collision (-0.08000000000000002 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 137.18790449255997 minutes (+0.10432997676635836 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission52.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission52\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission52\/altPolicy2.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission52\/altPolicy3.json"]}
