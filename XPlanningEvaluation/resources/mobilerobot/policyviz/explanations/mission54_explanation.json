{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission54\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission54\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.0 collision (0.2 in cost); take 138.57716744061383 minutes (1.225446976732248 in cost); and be non-intrusive 7.0 steps, very-intrusive 5.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps (2.833333333333333 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission54\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.9600000000000363 collision (-0.007999999999992735 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 140.47134518538377 minutes (+0.016750337978416407 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission54\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the time to 137.04025276384763 minutes (-0.013591037246057258 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 1.3199999999988319 collisions (+0.06399999999976635 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission54.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission54\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission54\/altPolicy2.json"]}
