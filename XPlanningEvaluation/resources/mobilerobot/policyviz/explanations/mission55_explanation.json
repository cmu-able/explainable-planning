{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission55\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission55\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.4 collisions (0.27999999999999997 in cost); take 131.34246077690926 minutes (1.935783319001819 in cost); and be non-intrusive 7.0 steps, very-intrusive 5.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps (1.6999999999999997 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission55\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 1.2799999999991867 collisions (-0.024000000000162613 in cost), and reduce the time to 129.8494272028713 minutes (-0.022004989629678562 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to non-intrusive 6.2 steps, very-intrusive 5.4 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps (+0.11999999999926225 in cost). The decrease in collision, and the decrease in time are not worth the increase in intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission55\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 1.3599999999971557 collisions (-0.00800000000056883 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 133.23663852139586 minutes (+0.027917229959850465 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission55.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission55\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission55\/altPolicy2.json"]}
