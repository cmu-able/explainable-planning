{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission56\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission56\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.0 collision (0.0 in cost); take 195.0797118102451 minutes (0.5550635977327618 in cost); and be non-intrusive 6.0 steps, very-intrusive 2.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 6.000000000000001 steps (0.4 in cost). It has the lowest expected collision, and intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission56\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 192.35401767022077 minutes (-0.0077554635571364106 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.03999999999987302 collision (+0.031999999999898415 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission56.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission56\/altPolicy1.json"]}
