{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission57\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission57\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.0 collision (0.2 in cost); take 123.38347157236265 minutes (2.1063904492025247 in cost); and be non-intrusive 4.0 steps, very-intrusive 3.0000000000000004 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 6.000000000000001 steps (1.0 in cost). It has the lowest expected time, and intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission57\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.9199999999971926 collision (-0.016000000000561482 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 125.80180727526589 minutes (+0.04128558843939878 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission57.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission57\/altPolicy1.json"]}
