{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission62\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission62\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.0 collision (0.0 in cost); take 157.30398645437901 minutes (0.4636831549975175 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 4.0 steps, very-intrusive 2.0 steps, and non-intrusive 7.0 steps (1.333333333333334 in cost). It has the lowest expected collision, and intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission62\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 154.53476228514216 minutes (-0.008162810292538347 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.0399999999999866 collision (+0.0199999999999933 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission62.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission62\/altPolicy1.json"]}
