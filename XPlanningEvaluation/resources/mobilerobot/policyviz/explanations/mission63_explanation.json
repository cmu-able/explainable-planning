It is expected to have 1.0 collision (0.3 in cost); take 126.2135904358939 minutes (1.8355232467293208 in cost); and be very-intrusive 0.0 step, somewhat-intrusive 7.0 steps, and non-intrusive 5.0 steps (0.4666666666666666 in cost).\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission63\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.6000000000000997 collision (-0.1199999999999701 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 137.2366996796308 minutes (+0.1603089904838162 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission63\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the intrusiveness to very-intrusive 0.0 step, somewhat-intrusive 6.0 steps, and non-intrusive 6.0 steps (-0.06666666666661064 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 1.399999999999865 collisions (+0.11999999999995947 in cost), and increase the time to 133.95171936351673 minutes (+0.11253554774717012 in cost). The decrease in intrusiveness is not worth the increase in collision, and the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission63\/altPolicy3.json] would reduce the time to 124.83171368191333 minutes (-0.020096622695592314 in cost).

The decrease in time is not worth the increase in intrusiveness, and the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission63.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission63\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission63\/altPolicy2.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission63\/altPolicy3.json"]}
