{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission63\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission63\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.0 collision (0.0 in cost); take 178.47063473081667 minutes (1.5782275233767464 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 3.0 steps, very-intrusive 3.0 steps, and non-intrusive 8.0 steps (0.8 in cost). It has the lowest expected collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission63\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the intrusiveness to somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps, very-intrusive 3.0 steps, and non-intrusive 8.0 steps (-0.06666666666893839 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 195.2891299412295 minutes (+0.14872705575843526 in cost). The decrease in intrusiveness is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission63\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the time to 168.48605499514497 minutes (-0.08829429318696724 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.20000000000018772 collision (+0.10000000000009386 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission63.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission63\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission63\/altPolicy2.json"]}
