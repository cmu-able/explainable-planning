{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission66\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission66\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.4 collisions (0.42 in cost); take 134.35858139456187 minutes (1.9802362395974393 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 3.0 steps, very-intrusive 3.0 steps, and non-intrusive 8.0 steps (0.8 in cost).\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission66\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 130.9884194678034 minutes (-0.04967093810763301 in cost), and reduce the intrusiveness to somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps, very-intrusive 3.0 steps, and non-intrusive 8.0 steps (-0.06666666667129328 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 1.7999999999934668 collisions (+0.11999999999804006 in cost). The decrease in time, and the decrease in intrusiveness are not worth the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission66\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 0.9999999999999998 collision (-0.12000000000000005 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 143.20703808047995 minutes (+0.1304124709571588 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission66.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission66\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission66\/altPolicy2.json"]}
