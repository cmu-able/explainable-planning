{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission67\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission67\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.0 collision (0.2 in cost); take 129.58652555014822 minutes (0.78851928721935 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 5.0 steps, non-intrusive 7.0 steps, and very-intrusive 0.0 step (0.8333333333333333 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission67\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 126.73329213843824 minutes (-0.017361601189016973 in cost), and reduce the collision to 0.6000000000001823 collision (-0.07999999999996354 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to somewhat-intrusive 6.0 steps, non-intrusive 8.0 steps, and very-intrusive 0.0 step (+0.1666666666671135 in cost). The decrease in time, and the decrease in collision are not worth the increase in intrusiveness.","Mission":"mission67.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission67\/altPolicy1.json"]}
