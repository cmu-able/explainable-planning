{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission68\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission68\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.6000000000000001 collision (0.12000000000000002 in cost); take 126.73329213832005 minutes (1.285262810049357 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 6.0 steps, non-intrusive 8.0 steps, and very-intrusive 0.0 step (0.5999999999999999 in cost).\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission68\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.4000000000000343 collision (-0.039999999999993166 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 134.07883924848232 minutes (+0.07449469954471755 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission68\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the time to 122.54187589920971 minutes (-0.042507152798381354 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to somewhat-intrusive 5.0 steps, non-intrusive 6.0 steps, and very-intrusive 1.0 step (+0.1999999999999197 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission68\/altPolicy3.json] would reduce the intrusiveness to somewhat-intrusive 5.0 steps, non-intrusive 7.0 steps, and very-intrusive 0.0 step (-0.10000000000037196 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 129.5865255500377 minutes (+0.028936001981772153 in cost), and increase the collision to 0.9999999999989881 collision (+0.07999999999979762 in cost). The decrease in intrusiveness is not worth the increase in time, and the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission68.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission68\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission68\/altPolicy2.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission68\/altPolicy3.json"]}
