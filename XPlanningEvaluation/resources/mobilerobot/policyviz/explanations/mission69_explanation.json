{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission69\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission69\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.0 collision (0.4 in cost); take 123.38347157236262 minutes (1.7553253743354373 in cost); and be very-intrusive 3.0 steps, non-intrusive 4.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 6.0 steps (0.5 in cost). It has the lowest expected time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission69\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.8 collision (-0.07999999999999996 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 130.46223692108998 minutes (+0.10070665282180968 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission69\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the intrusiveness to very-intrusive 2.0 steps, non-intrusive 6.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 6.0 steps (-0.09999999999958908 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 1.4000000000020627 collisions (+0.16000000000082504 in cost), and increase the time to 135.9787816396944 minutes (+0.17918824196678118 in cost). The decrease in intrusiveness is not worth the increase in collision, and the increase in time.","Mission":"mission69.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission69\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission69\/altPolicy2.json"]}
