{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission72\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission72\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.4000000000000001 collision (0.24000000000000005 in cost); take 129.8293949081061 minutes (1.148089850727368 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 4.0 steps, very-intrusive 2.0 steps, and non-intrusive 7.0 steps (0.3333333333333335 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission72\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.19999999999962878 collision (-0.12000000000022279 in cost), and reduce the time to 122.93743508995288 minutes (-0.06094605250562202 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to somewhat-intrusive 4.0 steps, very-intrusive 4.0 steps, and non-intrusive 6.0 steps (+0.19999999999979678 in cost). The decrease in collision, and the decrease in time are not worth the increase in intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission72\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 0.3599999999985968 collision (-0.024000000000841987 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 132.5986190771264 minutes (+0.024488430875699185 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission72.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission72\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission72\/altPolicy2.json"]}
