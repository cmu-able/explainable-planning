{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission73\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission73\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.4000000000000001 collision (0.08000000000000002 in cost); take 129.8293949081061 minutes (0.3826966169091227 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 4.0 steps, very-intrusive 2.0 steps, and non-intrusive 7.0 steps (2.333333333333334 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission73\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.3600000000000001 collision (-0.007999999999999993 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 132.59861907749 minutes (+0.008162810292971667 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission73\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the time to 125.0997492076368 minutes (-0.013941522334210421 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.552 collision (+0.030399999999999996 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission73.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission73\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission73\/altPolicy2.json"]}
