{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission74\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission74\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.0 collision (0.1 in cost); take 126.2135904358939 minutes (1.8355232467293208 in cost); and be very-intrusive 0.0 step, somewhat-intrusive 7.0 steps, and non-intrusive 5.0 steps (0.9333333333333332 in cost).\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission74\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.6000000000000855 collision (-0.03999999999999146 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 137.23669967962135 minutes (+0.16030899048367875 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission74\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the intrusiveness to very-intrusive 0.0 step, somewhat-intrusive 6.0 steps, and non-intrusive 6.0 steps (-0.13333333333322062 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 1.4000000000002295 collisions (+0.04000000000002296 in cost), and increase the time to 133.95171936354782 minutes (+0.11253554774762242 in cost). The decrease in intrusiveness is not worth the increase in collision, and the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission74\/altPolicy3.json] would reduce the time to 124.83171368190956 minutes (-0.02009662269564716 in cost).

The decrease in time is not worth the increase in intrusiveness, and the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission74.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission74\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission74\/altPolicy2.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission74\/altPolicy3.json"]}
