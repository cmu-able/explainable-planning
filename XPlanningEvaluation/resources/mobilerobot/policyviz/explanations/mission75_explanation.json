{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission75\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission75\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.2 collision (0.1 in cost); take 168.48605499515904 minutes (1.9865776402532056 in cost); and be non-intrusive 8.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 3.0 steps, and very-intrusive 3.0 steps (0.4 in cost).\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission75\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.11999999999984215 collision (-0.04000000000007893 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 176.91686167922578 minutes (+0.09940556830264358 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission75\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the intrusiveness to non-intrusive 8.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps, and very-intrusive 3.0000000000000004 steps (-0.033333333337115356 in cost), and reduce the time to 165.1158930678778 minutes (-0.0397367504922701 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.5999999999967263 collision (+0.19999999999836313 in cost). The decrease in intrusiveness, and the decrease in time are not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission75.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission75\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission75\/altPolicy2.json"]}
