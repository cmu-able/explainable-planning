{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission76\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission76\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.0 collision (0.0 in cost); take 169.79901613657478 minutes (1.2915096554805896 in cost); and be non-intrusive 6.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 5.0 steps, and very-intrusive 1.0 step (0.5333333333333333 in cost). It has the lowest expected collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission76\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 160.4280402966214 minutes (-0.07127665432902464 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.20000000000008233 collision (+0.10000000000004117 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission76\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the intrusiveness to non-intrusive 10.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 4.0 steps, and very-intrusive 1.0 step (-0.06666666666625154 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.40000000000062275 collision (+0.20000000000031137 in cost), and increase the time to 179.36445300988973 minutes (+0.07275574595108147 in cost). The decrease in intrusiveness is not worth the increase in collision, and the increase in time.","Mission":"mission76.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission76\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission76\/altPolicy2.json"]}
