{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission76\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission76\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.4 collisions (0.13999999999999999 in cost); take 131.34246077690926 minutes (2.3229399828021826 in cost); and be non-intrusive 7.0 steps, very-intrusive 5.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps (1.6999999999999997 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission76\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 1.2799999999989768 collisions (-0.01200000000010229 in cost), and reduce the time to 129.84942720285656 minutes (-0.026405987555874866 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to non-intrusive 6.2 steps, very-intrusive 5.4 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps (+0.11999999999863342 in cost). The decrease in collision, and the decrease in time are not worth the increase in intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission76\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 1.3599999999981494 collisions (-0.00400000000018505 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 133.23663852159038 minutes (+0.03350067595526163 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission76.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission76\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission76\/altPolicy2.json"]}
