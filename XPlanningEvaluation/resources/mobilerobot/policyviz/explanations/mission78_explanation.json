{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission78\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission78\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.8 collision (0.08000000000000002 in cost); take 170.7830515205403 minutes (0.4329981116298243 in cost); and be non-intrusive 12.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps, and very-intrusive 1.0 step (1.3333333333333333 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission78\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.6000000000001258 collision (-0.019999999999987438 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 179.60153891556973 minutes (+0.022358122515569956 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission78\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the time to 164.99528618974998 minutes (-0.014674122733351946 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 1.0 collision (+0.01999999999999999 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission78.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission78\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission78\/altPolicy2.json"]}
