{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission79\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission79\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.2 collisions (0.36 in cost); take 128.58891077421967 minutes (1.6301019054890387 in cost); and be non-intrusive 6.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 5.0 steps, and very-intrusive 1.0 step (0.5333333333333333 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness, and time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission79\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.999999999997639 collision (-0.06000000000070832 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 134.37667610482828 minutes (+0.07337061366445607 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission79.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission79\/altPolicy1.json"]}
