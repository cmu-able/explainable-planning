{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission79\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission79\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.2 collision (0.06 in cost); take 181.45124111046158 minutes (1.0325725598960847 in cost); and be very-intrusive 2.0 steps, non-intrusive 6.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 6.0 steps (2.0 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission79\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 179.19561353766 minutes (-0.012835950433659704 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.4 collision (+0.06 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission79\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 0.0 collision (-0.06 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 195.07971181002213 minutes (+0.07755463556817022 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission79.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission79\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission79\/altPolicy2.json"]}
