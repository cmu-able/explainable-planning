{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission79\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission79\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.20000000000000004 collision (0.06000000000000001 in cost); take 181.4512411104616 minutes (1.0325725598960847 in cost); and be non-intrusive 6.0 steps, very-intrusive 2.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 6.000000000000001 steps (2.0 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission79\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 178.04006311217003 minutes (-0.019411764705499213 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.28 collision (+0.023999999999999994 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission79\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 0.16000000000000003 collision (-0.012000000000000004 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 184.17693525049 minutes (+0.015510927114296136 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission79.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission79\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission79\/altPolicy2.json"]}
