{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission7\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission7\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.6000000000000001 collision (0.12000000000000002 in cost); take 149.82557845755505 minutes (0.8832782751971164 in cost); and be non-intrusive 7.0 steps, very-intrusive 5.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps (3.3999999999999995 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission7\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 148.1323574803585 minutes (-0.009982176072087623 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.7599999999993864 collision (+0.031999999999877266 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission7\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 0.56 collision (-0.008000000000000007 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 151.71975620227997 minutes (+0.011166891985345595 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission7.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission7\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission7\/altPolicy2.json"]}
