{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission7\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission7\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.6000000000000001 collision (0.12000000000000002 in cost); take 149.82557845755505 minutes (0.8832782751971164 in cost); and be non-intrusive 7.0 steps, very-intrusive 5.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps (3.3999999999999995 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission7\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.5600000000000033 collision (-0.007999999999999369 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 151.7197562022799 minutes (+0.011166891985345262 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission7\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the time to 148.13235748035433 minutes (-0.009982176072112381 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.7599999999993726 collision (+0.03199999999987452 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission7.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission7\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission7\/altPolicy2.json"]}
