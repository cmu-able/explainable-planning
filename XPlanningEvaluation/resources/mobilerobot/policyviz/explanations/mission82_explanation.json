{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission82\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission82\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.7999999999999998 collisions (0.18 in cost); take 160.82686632081064 minutes (1.4033423063758643 in cost); and be very-intrusive 0.0 step, somewhat-intrusive 4.0 steps, and non-intrusive 11.0 steps (0.7999999999999999 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission82\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 1.6 collisions (-0.019999999999999962 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 167.90563166951998 minutes (+0.06176785706273469 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission82\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 1.3999999999994404 collisions (-0.04000000000005596 in cost), and reduce the time to 153.08873739313077 minutes (-0.06752132864879967 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to very-intrusive 0.0 step, somewhat-intrusive 5.0 steps, and non-intrusive 10.0 steps (+0.19999999999961116 in cost). The decrease in collision, and the decrease in time are not worth the increase in intrusiveness.","Mission":"mission82.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission82\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission82\/altPolicy2.json"]}
