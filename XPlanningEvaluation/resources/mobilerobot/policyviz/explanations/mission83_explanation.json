{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission83\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission83\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.4 collision (0.12 in cost); take 153.6167804583472 minutes (0.9347406585499639 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 5.0 steps, non-intrusive 7.0 steps, and very-intrusive 0.0 step (0.6666666666666666 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission83\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.19999999999997514 collision (-0.06000000000000746 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 164.8092912201695 minutes (+0.06810515654030469 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission83\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the time to 144.561315466158 minutes (-0.05510147579593472 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.6000000000005679 collision (+0.06000000000017036 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission83.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission83\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission83\/altPolicy2.json"]}
