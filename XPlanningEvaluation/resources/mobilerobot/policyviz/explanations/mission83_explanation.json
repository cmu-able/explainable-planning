{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission83\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission83\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.0 collision (0.1 in cost); take 123.38347157236262 minutes (2.457455524069612 in cost); and be very-intrusive 3.0 steps, non-intrusive 4.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 6.0 steps (1.0 in cost). It has the lowest expected time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission83\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.8 collision (-0.01999999999999999 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 130.46223692108998 minutes (+0.14098931395053338 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission83\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the intrusiveness to very-intrusive 2.0 steps, non-intrusive 6.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 6.0 steps (-0.1999999999991544 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 1.4000000000021098 collisions (+0.04000000000021098 in cost), and increase the time to 135.9787816396981 minutes (+0.25086353875356737 in cost). The decrease in intrusiveness is not worth the increase in collision, and the increase in time.","Mission":"mission83.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission83\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission83\/altPolicy2.json"]}
