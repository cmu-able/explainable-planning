{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission84\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission84\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.4000000000000001 collisions (0.28 in cost); take 135.9787816394753 minutes (1.160708169779461 in cost); and be very-intrusive 2.0 steps, non-intrusive 6.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 6.0 steps (2.0 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission84\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.8 collision (-0.12 in cost), and reduce the time to 130.46223692108998 minutes (-0.04708895348511288 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to very-intrusive 3.0 steps, non-intrusive 4.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 6.0 steps (+0.49999999999999956 in cost). The decrease in collision, and the decrease in time are not worth the increase in intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission84\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 1.2 collisions (-0.040000000000000036 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 143.05754698823 minutes (+0.06042399169331936 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission84.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission84\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission84\/altPolicy2.json"]}
