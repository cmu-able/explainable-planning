{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission84\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission84\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.0 collision (0.1 in cost); take 126.73519003137605 minutes (0.61436962183932 in cost); and be very-intrusive 1.0 step, non-intrusive 6.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 5.0 steps (1.8666666666666665 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness, and time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission84\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.8 collision (-0.01999999999999999 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 136.20607875486002 minutes (+0.04591168658119815 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission84.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission84\/altPolicy1.json"]}
