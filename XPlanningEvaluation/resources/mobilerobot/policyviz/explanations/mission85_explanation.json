{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission85\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission85\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.4000000000000001 collisions (0.28 in cost); take 135.9787816394753 minutes (1.934513616299102 in cost); and be very-intrusive 2.0 steps, non-intrusive 6.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 6.0 steps (1.2 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission85\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.8000000000003115 collision (-0.11999999999993771 in cost), and reduce the time to 133.89878589596069 minutes (-0.029591235037990105 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to very-intrusive 3.0 steps, non-intrusive 4.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 6.0 steps (+0.3000000000006886 in cost). The decrease in collision, and the decrease in time are not worth the increase in intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission85\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 1.2 collisions (-0.040000000000000036 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 143.05754698823 minutes (+0.1007066528221987 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission85.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission85\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission85\/altPolicy2.json"]}
