{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission85\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission85\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.4000000000000001 collisions (0.28 in cost); take 135.97878163947533 minutes (1.9345136162991017 in cost); and be non-intrusive 6.0 steps, very-intrusive 2.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 6.000000000000001 steps (1.2 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission85\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 133.056814385909 minutes (-0.041569613804828265 in cost), and reduce the collision to 0.6799999999993818 collision (-0.14400000000012367 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to non-intrusive 4.0 steps, very-intrusive 3.0000000000000004 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 6.000000000000001 steps (+0.29999999999872484 in cost). The decrease in time, and the decrease in collision are not worth the increase in intrusiveness.","Mission":"mission85.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission85\/altPolicy1.json"]}
