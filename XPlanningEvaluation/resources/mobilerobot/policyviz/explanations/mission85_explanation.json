It is expected to have 1.0 collision (0.2 in cost); take 126.2135904358939 minutes (2.569732545421049 in cost); and be very-intrusive 0.0 step, somewhat-intrusive 7.0 steps, and non-intrusive 5.0 steps (0.2333333333333333 in cost).\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission85\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.6000000000000997 collision (-0.07999999999998007 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 137.23669967963522 minutes (+0.22443258667743304 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission85\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the intrusiveness to very-intrusive 0.0 step, somewhat-intrusive 6.0 steps, and non-intrusive 6.0 steps (-0.03333333333330568 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 1.3999999999998818 collisions (+0.07999999999997637 in cost), and increase the time to 133.95171936351886 minutes (+0.15754976684608213 in cost). The decrease in intrusiveness is not worth the increase in collision, and the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission85\/altPolicy3.json] would reduce the time to 124.83171368105647 minutes (-0.02813527179127462 in cost).

The decrease in time is not worth the increase in intrusiveness, and the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission85.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission85\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission85\/altPolicy2.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission85\/altPolicy3.json"]}
