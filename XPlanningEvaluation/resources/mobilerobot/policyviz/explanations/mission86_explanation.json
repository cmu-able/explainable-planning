{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission86\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission86\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.4 collision (0.16000000000000003 in cost); take 156.64439837711794 minutes (1.3706384857997818 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 6.000000000000001 steps, very-intrusive 0.0 step, and non-intrusive 7.0 steps (0.5999999999999999 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission86\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.35999999999972787 collision (-0.01600000000010887 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 158.5790669391293 minutes (+0.016928349917600283 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission86\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the time to 155.07704486409284 minutes (-0.013714343238969029 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.52 collision (+0.04799999999999999 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission86.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission86\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission86\/altPolicy2.json"]}
