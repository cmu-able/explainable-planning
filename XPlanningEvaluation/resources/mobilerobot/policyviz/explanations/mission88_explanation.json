{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission88\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission88\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.0 collision (0.0 in cost); take 174.0362448246809 minutes (1.5390139227202397 in cost); and be non-intrusive 7.0 steps, very-intrusive 5.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps (0.5666666666666667 in cost). It has the lowest expected collision, and intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission88\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 172.14206708009 minutes (-0.016750337976833007 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.04 collision (+0.024 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission88.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission88\/altPolicy1.json"]}
