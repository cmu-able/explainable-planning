{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission89\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission89\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.0 collision (0.0 in cost); take 174.0362448246809 minutes (1.0260092818134934 in cost); and be non-intrusive 7.0 steps, very-intrusive 5.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps (2.266666666666667 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness, and collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission89\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 164.56535610136999 minutes (-0.05583445992487723 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.2 collision (+0.08000000000000002 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission89.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission89\/altPolicy1.json"]}
