{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission92\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission92\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.0 collision (0.2 in cost); take 151.1562073943624 minutes (0.8911228344795197 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps, very-intrusive 3.0 steps, and non-intrusive 8.0 steps (2.2 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission92\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.8 collision (-0.03999999999999998 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 160.82955020805997 minutes (+0.05702800312093381 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission92\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the time to 149.51021896769802 minutes (-0.009703722378154866 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 1.199999999999518 collisions (+0.039999999999903585 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission92.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission92\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission92\/altPolicy2.json"]}
