{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission93\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission93\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.20000000000000004 collision (0.08000000000000002 in cost); take 164.5653561012858 minutes (1.4552622328321798 in cost); and be non-intrusive 7.0 steps, very-intrusive 5.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps (1.6999999999999997 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission93\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.16000000000002843 collision (-0.01599999999998865 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 166.45953384604945 minutes (+0.01675033797836023 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission93\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the time to 162.60213579307995 minutes (-0.017360885893278333 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.3199999999994517 collision (+0.04799999999978069 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission93.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission93\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission93\/altPolicy2.json"]}
