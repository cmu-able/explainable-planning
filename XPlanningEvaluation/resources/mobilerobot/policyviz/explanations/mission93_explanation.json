{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission93\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission93\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.0 collision (0.0 in cost); take 152.60519296456872 minutes (0.9285852635645068 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 6.0 steps, non-intrusive 8.0 steps, and very-intrusive 0.0 step (0.19999999999999998 in cost). It has the lowest expected collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission93\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 145.25964585392916 minutes (-0.044696819729734605 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.19999999999988763 collision (+0.11999999999993258 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission93\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the intrusiveness to somewhat-intrusive 5.0 steps, non-intrusive 7.0 steps, and very-intrusive 0.0 step (-0.033333333333475795 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 178.65541206646964 minutes (+0.15851262398566035 in cost). The decrease in intrusiveness is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission93.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission93\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission93\/altPolicy2.json"]}
