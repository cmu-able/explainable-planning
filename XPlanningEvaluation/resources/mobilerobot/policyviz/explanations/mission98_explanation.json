{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission98\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission98\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.6000000000000001 collision (0.24000000000000005 in cost); take 138.8625899807392 minutes (1.6828979558277026 in cost); and be very-intrusive 1.0 step, non-intrusive 6.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 5.0 steps (0.26666666666666666 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission98\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.39999999999841657 collision (-0.0800000000006334 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 148.3334787038854 minutes (+0.11477921644890188 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission98\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the time to 136.20607875473058 minutes (-0.03219468477797638 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.7999999999993921 collision (+0.07999999999975682 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission98.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission98\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission98\/altPolicy2.json"]}
