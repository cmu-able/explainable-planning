{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission98\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission98\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.0 collision (0.0 in cost); take 176.8330555142223 minutes (1.031526157166297 in cost); and be very-intrusive 0.0 step, non-intrusive 7.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 6.0 steps (0.5999999999999999 in cost). It has the lowest expected collision, and intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission98\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 171.98285047641 minutes (-0.028292862720571854 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.2 collision (+0.1 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission98.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission98\/altPolicy1.json"]}
