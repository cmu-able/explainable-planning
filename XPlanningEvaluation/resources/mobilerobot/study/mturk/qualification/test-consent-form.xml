		<Title>Basic Arithmetic Test</Title>
		<Text>Please answer the following questions. Your answers will determine your eligibility to participate in this study. You are allowed to use a calculator.</Text>
		<Text>Suppose you task a mobile robot to deliver a package at some destination. Suppose the robot then informs you that it has computed a navigation route that will take 6 minutes, but the route has 2 segments where the robot has 20% chance of colliding with obstacles (i.e., the expected value of collision is 0.4).</Text>
		<Text>Suppose that you wish to quantify how "costly" the route is, by assigning $1 to each minute of the route, and $2 to each 0.1 expected collision of the route.</Text>

		<Text>The purpose of this study is to examine how people interpret and understand the objectives of an autonomous agent (e.g., a robot) by observing its behavior. Your participation in the study will contribute to a better understanding of human interaction with artificial intelligence. We estimate that it will take about 15 to 20 minutes of your time to complete the task. You are free to contact the investigator at the above address and phone number to discuss this study.</Text>
		<Text>Risks to participants are considered minimal. There will be no costs for participating. You will be paid for each HIT you complete, but will not otherwise benefit from participating. Your MTurk worker ID will only be collected for the purposes of distributing compensation and will not be associated with your study data. A limited number of research team members will have access to the data during data collection. Your MTurk worker ID will be stripped from the final dataset.</Text>
		<Text>Your participation in this study is voluntary. You may decline to answer any question and you have the right to withdraw from participation at any time without penalty. If you wish to withdraw from the study or have any questions, contact the investigator listed above.</Text>
		<Text>This study has been reviewed and approved by Carnegie Mellon University Institutional Review Board.
