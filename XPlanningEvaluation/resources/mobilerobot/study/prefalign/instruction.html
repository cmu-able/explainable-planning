			<!-- Introduction -->
			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>Our research aims to understand how people interpret and understand the objectives of an autonomous agent (e.g., a robot) by observing its behavior. In this study, consider a mobile robot navigating inside a building. Its task is to move from its current location to a given destination (see Figures 1 and 2 for illustration). The robot must navigate to the destination while optimizing for 3 objectives, namely, minimizing its driving time, its expected collisions with obstacles, and its intrusiveness to human occupants in the building (see Figures 3-7 for details).</p>
			<div class="w3-row w3-margin">

					<p><b>Figure 1</b>: The robot has to navigate from its current location to a given goal.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="w3-container w3-half">
					<img src="imgs/topology.png">
					<p><b>Figure 2</b>: The map of the building in Figure 1 is represented abstractly by a set of <i>waypoints</i> and <i>connections</i> among them. Each waypoint represents a location in the building, and a connection between 2 waypoints means that Robot can move between the 2 locations.</p>
					<p>The distances between waypoints are to scale, and waypoints 1 and 2 are 10 meters apart.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<!-- Collision -->
			<div class="w3-row w3-margin">
				<div class="w3-container w3-half crop">
					<img src="imgs/obstacles.png">
					<p><b>Figure 3</b>: There are some obstacles around the building. When the robot moves at a high speed through a path with obstacles, it <i>may</i> collide with them -- with higher chance of collision when the obstacles are <i>dense</i> than when they are <i>sparse</i>. But when the robot moves at a low speed, it can avoid the collision.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="w3-container w3-half">
					<img src="imgs/obstacles-abstract.png">
					<p><b>Figure 4</b>: In an abstract map, obstacles are represented on a connection between 2 waypoints. The "SO" notation on the map denotes sparse obstacles, and the "DO" notation denotes dense obstacles. The <i>expected collision</i> when the robot moves from one waypoint to the next depends on the speed of the robot and the obstacle density, as shown in Figure 5.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="w3-container w3-center w3-margin">
				<img src="imgs/collision-table.png" class="w3-image">
				<p class="w3-left-align"><b>Figure 5</b>: The robot may drive at its full speed: 0.7 meters/second, or at half speed: 0.35 meters/second. The robot can avoid collision with obstacles when it moves at half speed. That is, the expected collision of moving at half speed is always 0.0.</p>
				<p class="w3-left-align">Every time the robot moves at full speed through <i>sparse</i> obstacles (SO), and through <i>dense</i> obstacles (DO), it has 20% and 40% probability of colliding, respectively. In other words, the expected collision of moving at full speed through each SO and DO is 0.2 and 0.4, respectively.</p>
			</div>
			
			<!-- Intrusiveness -->
			<div class="w3-row w3-margin">
				<div class="w3-container w3-half crop">
					<img src="imgs/fullmap.png">
					<p><b>Figure 6</b>: The building has private offices (in red) and semi-private conference rooms (in yellow). If the robot drives through a corridor of private offices, it would be considered very intrusive to the human occupants. Similarly, if the robot drives through a corridor of semi-private conference rooms, it would be considered somewhat intrusive. The rest of the building is public space, which the robot can drive around without being considered intrusive.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="w3-container w3-half">
					<img src="imgs/fullmap-abstract.png">
					<p><b>Figure 7</b>: In an abstract map, each waypoint is color-coded to represent the <i>intrusiveness</i> of the robot if it drives to that location. When the robot drives to a PUBLIC waypoint, it does not receive any <i>intrusiveness penalty</i>. However, each time the robot drives to a SEMI-PRIVATE or a PRIVATE waypoint, it receives a penalty of 1 or 3, respectively.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<!-- Tradeoffs and Cost Profile -->
			<p>However, it is not always possible to find a way to the destination that takes the shortest amount of time, has the lowest expected collisions, and is the least intrusive to human occupants. The robot may need to make a tradeoff among these objectives. For instance, the robot may need to take a detour to the destination to minimize its intrusiveness. Or it may take the shortest route to the destination, but at the expense of being more intrusive. Which option is subjectively better depends on how one weighs the importance of each of the objectives.</p>
			<p>Suppose a user of the robot wants the robot to deliver a package at some destination. The user has in mind how they would weigh the importance of each objective. For instance, the user may mainly care about the robot minimizing its expected collisions because the package is fragile, and not care much about the package being delivered very quickly. The user's concerns can be represented by a <i>cost profile</i>, for instance:</p>
			
			<!-- Cost Profile Table -->
			<div class="w3-responsive w3-cell">
				<table class="w3-table" style="max-width:500px;min-width:350px">
					<tr>
						<th></th>
						<th class="w3-right-align">Cost ($)</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>1 second of travel time</td>
						<td class="w3-right-align">$1</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>0.1 expected collision</td>
						<td class="w3-right-align">$9</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>1 intrusiveness-penalty</td>
						<td class="w3-right-align">$5</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
			</div>
			<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle" style="max-width:800px;padding-left:80px">
				<p>A <i>total cost</i> of a navigation plan can be computed from the cost profile. For example, a navigation plan that takes 120 seconds, has 0.2 expected collision, and has intrusiveness penalty of 7 would have a total cost of: ($1 * 120) + ($9 * 0.2/0.1) + ($5 * 7) = $173.</p>
				<p><b>A best navigation, with respect to a particular cost profile, is one that has the lowest total cost.</b></p>
			</div>
			
			<p>Unfortunately, the user cannot control how the robot weighs its objectives. The robot will make its own decision on how to navigate to the destination, and its decision may or may not be in agreement with how the user would weigh the objectives. However, the robot will present its navigation plan to the user before it is taking off.</p>
			
			<!-- Task -->
			<div class="w3-pale-red w3-padding-large">
				<h3>Task</h3>
				<p>Imagine that you are the user of the robot. <b>You will be given a cost profile</b>, similar to the one shown above. You will be presented with a series of 4 navigation problems (each with a different map) and the corresponding navigation plans that the robot came up with. <b>You task is to determine whether the robot's plan is the best available option for you.</b></p>
			</div>
			
			<!-- Example -->
			<h4>Example</h4>
			<p>Suppose that you are given the cost profile above. Suppose that the robot presents the following plan and informs you than the navigation will take 80 seconds:</p>
			<div class="w3-row w3-margin">
				<div class="w3-container w3-half crop">
					<img src="imgs/plan1.png">
					<p><b>Figure 8</b>: The robot's navigation plan. This navigation will take 80 seconds</p>
				</div>
				<div class="w3-container w3-half">
					<img src="imgs/plan1-abstract.png">
					<p><b>Figure 9</b>: This is the abstract navigation plan of Figure 8. Here, the robot plans to drive at full speed through waypoints 1 to 6.</p>
					<p>This plan takes the least amount of time. But it incurs intrusiveness-penalty of 10, since it drives through a SEMI-PRIVATE waypoint 1 time and a PRIVATE waypoint 3 times. This plan also has the expected collision of 0.4, since it moves through DO at full speed.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<p>You can calculate the total cost of the robot's presented navigation plan in Figure 9: ($1 * 80) + ($9 * 0.4/0.1) + ($5 * 10) = $166. However, this plan is NOT the best available option according to the cost profile, because the following alternative navigation would be a better option:</p>
			<div class="w3-row w3-margin">
				<div class="w3-container w3-half crop">
					<img src="imgs/plan2.png">
					<p><b>Figure 10</b>: A different navigation plan, which is the least intrusive and avoids collision. But it takes 128 seconds.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="w3-container w3-half">
					<img src="imgs/plan2-abstract.png">
					<p><b>Figure 11</b>: This is the abstract navigation plan of Figure 10. Here, the robot plans to drive through waypoints 1-2-3-8-9-10-11-6 at full speed except from waypoints 9-10, where there are sparse obstacles (SO).</p>
					<p>This plan incurs intrusiveness-penalty of 4 (since it drives through a SEMI-PRIVATE waypoint 1 time and a PRIVATE waypoint 1 time), which is the lowest among all possible plans. It also has the lowest expected collision (no collision). However, this plan takes more time to reach the destination than the plan in Figure 9.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>You can calculate the total cost of the alternative navigation plan in Figure 11: ($1 * 128) + ($9 * 0.0/0.1) + ($5 * 4) = $148. This plan costs less than the one that the robot presented.</p>
