			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>Our research aims to understand how people interpret and understand the objectives of an autonomous agent (e.g., a robot) by observing its behavior. In this study, consider a mobile robot navigating inside a building. Its task is to move from its current location to a given destination (see Figures 1 and 2 for illustration). The robot must navigate to the destination while optimizing for 3 objectives, namely, minimizing its driving time, its expected collisions with obstacles, and its intrusiveness to human occupants in the building (see Figures 3-7 for details).</p>
			<div class="w3-row w3-margin">
				<div class="w3-container w3-half crop">

					<p><b>Figure 1</b>: Robot has to navigate from its location to a given goal.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="w3-container w3-half">
					<img src="imgs/topology.png">
					<p><b>Figure 2</b>: The map of the building in Figure 1 is represented abstractly by a set of <i>waypoints</i> and <i>connections</i> among them. Each waypoint represents a location in the building, and a connection between 2 waypoints means that Robot can move between the 2 locations.</p>
					<p>The distances between waypoints are to scale, and waypoints 1 and 2 are 15 meters apart.</p>
				</div>

			<!-- Collision -->
			<div class="w3-row w3-margin">
				<div class="w3-container w3-half crop">
					<img src="imgs/obstacles.png">
					<p><b>Figure 3</b>: There are some obstacles around the building. When Robot moves through a path with obstacles, it <i>may</i> bump into them. Robot is more likely to bump into obstacles when they are <i>dense</i> than when they are <i>sparse</i>.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="w3-container w3-half">
					<img src="imgs/obstacles-abstract.png">
					<p><b>Figure 4</b>: In an abstract map, obstacles are represented on a connection between 2 waypoints. This means when Robot moves from one waypoint to the other, it <i>may</i> bump into the obstacles on the way. The "SO" notation on the map denotes sparse obstacles, and the "DO" notation denotes dense obstacles.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="w3-container w3-center w3-margin">
				<img src="imgs/collision-table.png" class="w3-image">
				<p class="w3-left-align">
				<b>Figure 5</b>: A <i>collision</i> occurs when Robot bumps into obstacles while moving at its full speed (i.e., 0.7 meters/second). However, bumping into obstacles at low speed (i.e., 0.35 meters/second) does NOT result in a collision.
				</p>
				<p class="w3-left-align">
				Every time Robot moves through <i>sparse</i> obstacles (SO), and through <i>dense</i> obstacles (DO), at full speed, it has 20% and 40% probability of colliding, respectively. In other words, the <i>expected collision</i> of moving at full speed through each SO and DO is 0.2 and 0.4, respectively.
				</p>
			</div>
			
			<!-- Intrusiveness -->
			<div class="w3-row w3-margin">
				<div class="w3-container w3-half crop">
					<img src="imgs/zones.png">
					<p><b>Figure 6</b>: The building has 3 types of zones: (i) <i>public zones</i>, which are appropriate for Robot to move around without being intrusive to human occupants, (ii) <i>semi-private zones</i> and (iii) <i>private zones</i>, which Robot is discouraged from entering, since it may be somewhat intrusive, and very intrusive, to the human occupants, respectively.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="w3-container w3-half">
					<img src="imgs/zones-abstract.png">
					<p><b>Figure 7</b>: In an abstract map, each waypoint is color-coded to represent the type of zone in which it belongs. When Robot enters a <i>PUBLIC</i> waypoint, it does not receive any <i>intrusiveness penalty</i>. However, each time Robot enters a <i>SEMI-PRIVATE</i> or a <i>PRIVATE</i> waypoint, it receives a penalty of 1 or 3, respectively. Note that Robot will NOT get any penalty for being in its starting waypoint.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>However, it is not always possible to find a way to the destination that takes the shortest amount of time, has the lowest expected collisions, and is the least intrusive to human occupants. The robot may need to make a tradeoff among these objectives. For instance, to avoid driving through private zones of the building (i.e., being intrusive), it would need to take a detour to the destination.</p>

					<p>This plan takes the least amount of time.

This plan also has the expected collision of 0.4, since it moves through DO at full speed.</p>

					<p><b>Figure 13</b>: This is the abstract navigation plan of Figure 12. Here, Robot plans to drive through waypoints 1-2-7-8-9-10-5 at full speed except from waypoints 8-9, where there is SO.</p>
					<p>This plan has the cumulative intrusiveness-penalty of 3, which is the lowest among all possible plans. It also has the lowest expected collision (no collision). However, this plan takes more time to reach the destination than the plan in Figure 11.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>Imagine that you are a user of the robot -- you want the robot to deliver a package at some destination. You have in mind how you would weigh the importance of each of the objectives. For instance, if you are in a rush to deliver the package, you may want the robot to get to the destination as soon as possible, even if it has to be more intrusive to the building occupants.</p>
			<p>Unfortunately, you cannot control how the robot weighs its objectives. The robot will make its own decision on how to navigate to the destination, and its decision may or may not be in agreement with how you would weigh the objectives. However, you are able to see the robot's plan before it is taking off.</p>
		</div>
			
		<!-- Task -->
		<div class="w3-container">
		<h3>Task</h3>
		<p>In this task, you are given a <i>cost profile</i> representing how a hypothetical robot's user weighs the importance of the 3 objectives. An example of a cost profile is:</p>
			<div class="w3-responsive w3-cell">
				<table class="w3-table" style="max-width:500px;min-width:350px">
					<tr>
						<th></th>
						<th class="w3-right-align">Cost ($)</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>1 minute of travel time</td>
						<td class="w3-right-align">$1</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>0.1 expected collision</td>
						<td class="w3-right-align">$9</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>1 intrusiveness-penalty</td>
						<td class="w3-right-align">$5</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
			</div>
			<div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-cell-middle" style="max-width:800px;padding-left:80px">
				<p>A <i>total cost</i> of a navigation plan can be computed from the cost profile. For example, consider the navigation plan in Figure 13: it takes 112 seconds, has 0 expected collision, and has intrusiveness penalty of 3. Thus, its total cost is ($1 * 112) + ($9 * 0/0.1) + ($5 * 3) = $127.</p>
				<p><b>A best navigation, with respect to a particular cost profile, is one that has the lowest total cost.</b></p>
			</div>
	 <p>Then, <b>you will be presented with a series of 3 navigation problems and the corresponding navigation plans that the robot came up with</b>. However, the robot <i>may</i> have weighed the objectives differently than your given cost profile. In other words, each of the robot's plans may or may not prioritize the objectives as the hypothetical user wishes.</p>
		<p><b>Your task is to determine whether the robot's plan is the best available option for this hypothetical user.</b></p>
	</div>
		
		<!-- Example -->
		<div class="w3-container">
			<h4>Example</h4>
			<p>Using the example cost profile above, suppose that the robot presents you with the navigation plan in Figure 11. The robot informs you that this navigation takes 78 seconds, has 0.4 expected collision, and has intrusiveness-penalty of 9.</p>
			<p>We can see that the proposed navigation plan is NOT the best option for the hypothetical user. The total cost of this plan is ($1 * 78) + ($9 * 0.4/0.1) + ($5 * 9) = $159. But there is another possible plan that has a lower total cost, namely, the plan in Figure 13, which has $127 in total cost as shown above.</p>
