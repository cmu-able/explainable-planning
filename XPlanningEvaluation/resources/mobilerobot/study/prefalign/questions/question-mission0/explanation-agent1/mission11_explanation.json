{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission11\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission11\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to take 131 minutes; have 1.2 collisions; and have intrusiveness-penalty of 10: it will be non-intrusive at 8 locations (0-penalty), somewhat-intrusive at 1 location (1-penalty), and very-intrusive at 3 locations (9-penalty). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission11\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 1 collision. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the travel time to 137 minutes. The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in travel time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission11\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the travel time to 127 minutes. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to 13: non-intrusive at 8 locations (0-penalty), somewhat-intrusive at 1 location (1-penalty), and very-intrusive at 4 locations (12-penalty), and increase the collision to 1.4 collisions. The decrease in travel time is not worth the increase in intrusiveness, and the increase in collision.","solnPolicy.json":{"collision":"1.2","travelTime":"131","intrusiveness":{"Value":"10","Event-based Values":{"non-intrusive":"8","very-intrusive":"3","somewhat-intrusive":"1"}}},"Mission":"mission11.json","altPolicy1.json":{"collision":"1","travelTime":"137","intrusiveness":{"Value":"10","Event-based Values":{"non-intrusive":"8","very-intrusive":"3","somewhat-intrusive":"1"}}},"Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission11\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission11\/altPolicy2.json"],"altPolicy2.json":{"collision":"1.4","travelTime":"127","intrusiveness":{"Value":"13","Event-based Values":{"non-intrusive":"8","very-intrusive":"4","somewhat-intrusive":"1"}}}}
