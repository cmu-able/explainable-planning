{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission12\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission12\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.2 collision (0.08000000000000002 in cost); take 172.6489077496328 minutes (0.7003659940722083 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 1.0 step, very-intrusive 3.0 steps, and non-intrusive 8.0 steps (1.3333333333333335 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission12\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 158.80278690319207 minutes (-0.05616804830716926 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.39999999999972047 collision (+0.07999999999988819 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission12\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 0.0 collision (-0.08000000000000002 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 192.67067967138664 minutes (+0.08122013847548337 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission12.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission12\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission12\/altPolicy2.json"]}
