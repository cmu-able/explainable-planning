{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission0\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission0\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.6000000000000001 collision (0.19800000000000004 in cost); take 148.28747257962635 minutes (0.9925436680565696 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 1.0 step, very-intrusive 3.0 steps, and non-intrusive 8.0 steps (1.1 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission0\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.40000000000054065 collision (-0.06599999999982162 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 158.8027869034867 minutes (+0.07038294245771715 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission0\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the time to 142.49970724888001 minutes (-0.038739684015755005 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.8 collision (+0.06599999999999998 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission0.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission0\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission0\/altPolicy2.json"]}
