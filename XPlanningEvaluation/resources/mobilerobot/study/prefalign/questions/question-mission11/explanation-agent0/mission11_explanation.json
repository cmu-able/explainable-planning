{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission11\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission11\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to take 149 seconds; have 0.2 expected collision; and have intrusiveness-penalty of 10: it will be non-intrusive at 8 locations (0-penalty), somewhat-intrusive at 1 location (1-penalty), and very-intrusive at 3 locations (9-penalty). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission11\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the expected collision by 0.2. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the expected intrusiveness by 3: it would be non-intrusive at 8 locations (0-penalty), somewhat-intrusive at 1 location (1-penalty), and very-intrusive at 4 locations (12-penalty), and increase the expected travel time by 4 seconds. The decrease in expected collision is not worth the increase in expected intrusiveness, and the increase in expected travel time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission11\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the expected collision by 0.2, and reduce the expected travel time by 2 seconds. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the expected intrusiveness by 5: it would be non-intrusive at 7 locations (0-penalty), somewhat-intrusive at 3 locations (3-penalty), and very-intrusive at 4 locations (12-penalty). The decrease in expected collision, and the decrease in expected travel time are not worth the increase in expected intrusiveness.","solnPolicy.json":{"collision":"0.2","travelTime":"149","intrusiveness":{"Value":"10","Event-based Values":{"non-intrusive":"8","very-intrusive":"3","somewhat-intrusive":"1"}}},"Mission":"mission11.json","altPolicy1.json":{"collision":"0","travelTime":"152","intrusiveness":{"Value":"13","Event-based Values":{"non-intrusive":"8","very-intrusive":"4","somewhat-intrusive":"1"}}},"Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission11\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission11\/altPolicy2.json"],"altPolicy2.json":{"collision":"0","travelTime":"147","intrusiveness":{"Value":"15","Event-based Values":{"non-intrusive":"7","very-intrusive":"4","somewhat-intrusive":"3"}}}}
