{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission14\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission14\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to take 127 minutes; have 0.6 collision; and have intrusiveness-penalty of 6: be non-intrusive 8 steps, somewhat-intrusive 6 steps, and very-intrusive 0 step. It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission14\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.4 collision. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the travel time to 134 minutes. The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in travel time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission14\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the travel time to 123 minutes. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to 8: non-intrusive 6 steps, somewhat-intrusive 5 steps, and very-intrusive 1 step. The decrease in travel time is not worth the increase in intrusiveness.","solnPolicy.json":{"collision":"0.6","travelTime":"127","intrusiveness":{"non-intrusive":"8","very-intrusive":"0","somewhat-intrusive":"6"}},"Mission":"mission14.json","altPolicy1.json":{"collision":"0.4","travelTime":"134","intrusiveness":{"non-intrusive":"8","very-intrusive":"0","somewhat-intrusive":"6"}},"Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission14\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission14\/altPolicy2.json"],"altPolicy2.json":{"collision":"0.6","travelTime":"123","intrusiveness":{"non-intrusive":"6","very-intrusive":"1","somewhat-intrusive":"5"}}}
