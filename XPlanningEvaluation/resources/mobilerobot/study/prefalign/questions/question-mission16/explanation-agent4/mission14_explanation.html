  <p>I'm planning to follow this policy (see Figure 1). It is expected to take 127 minutes; have 0.6 collision; and have intrusiveness-penalty of 6: it will be non-intrusive at 8 locations (0-penalty), somewhat-intrusive at 6 locations (6-penalty), and very-intrusive at 0 location (0-penalty).</p>

  <p>Alternatively, following this policy (see Figure 2) would reduce the travel time to 123 minutes.
