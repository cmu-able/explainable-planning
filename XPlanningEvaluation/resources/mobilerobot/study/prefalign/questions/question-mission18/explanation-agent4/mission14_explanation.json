{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission14\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission14\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.6000000000000001 collision (0.12000000000000002 in cost); take 126.73329213832005 minutes (1.5423153720592284 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 6.0 steps, very-intrusive 0.0 step, and non-intrusive 8.0 steps (0.39999999999999997 in cost).\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission14\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 122.54187589918001 minutes (-0.05100858335841929 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to somewhat-intrusive 5.0 steps, very-intrusive 1.0 step, and non-intrusive 6.0 steps (+0.13333333333333336 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission14\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 0.4000000000000627 collision (-0.039999999999987476 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 134.07883924899 minutes (+0.08939363945983936 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission14\/altPolicy3.json] would reduce the intrusiveness to somewhat-intrusive 5.0 steps, very-intrusive 0.0 step, and non-intrusive 7.0 steps (-0.06666666666666665 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 129.58652555016002 minutes (+0.03472320237961468 in cost), and increase the collision to 1.0 collision (+0.07999999999999999 in cost). The decrease in intrusiveness is not worth the increase in time, and the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission14.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission14\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission14\/altPolicy2.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission14\/altPolicy3.json"]}
