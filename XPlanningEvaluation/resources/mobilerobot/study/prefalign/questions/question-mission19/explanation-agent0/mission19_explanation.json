{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission19\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission19\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to take 127 minutes; have 0.6 expected collision; and have intrusiveness-penalty of 6: it will be non-intrusive at 8 locations (0-penalty), somewhat-intrusive at 6 locations (6-penalty), and very-intrusive at 0 location (0-penalty).\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission19\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the expected travel time by 4 minutes. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the expected intrusiveness by 2: it would be non-intrusive at 6 locations (0-penalty), somewhat-intrusive at 5 locations (5-penalty), and very-intrusive at 1 location (3-penalty). The decrease in expected travel time is not worth the increase in expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission19\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the expected intrusiveness by 1: it would be non-intrusive at 7 locations (0-penalty), somewhat-intrusive at 5 locations (5-penalty), and very-intrusive at 0 location (0-penalty). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the expected collision by 0.4, and increase the expected travel time by 3 minutes. The decrease in expected intrusiveness is not worth the increase in expected collision, and the increase in expected travel time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission19\/altPolicy3.json] would reduce the expected collision by 0.2. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the expected travel time by 7 minutes. The decrease in expected collision is not worth the increase in expected travel time.","solnPolicy.json":{"collision":"0.6","travelTime":"127","intrusiveness":{"Value":"6","Event-based Values":{"non-intrusive":"8","very-intrusive":"0","somewhat-intrusive":"6"}}},"Mission":"mission19.json","altPolicy1.json":{"collision":"0.6","travelTime":"123","intrusiveness":{"Value":"8","Event-based Values":{"non-intrusive":"6","very-intrusive":"1","somewhat-intrusive":"5"}}},"altPolicy3.json":{"collision":"0.4","travelTime":"134","intrusiveness":{"Value":"6","Event-based Values":{"non-intrusive":"8","very-intrusive":"0","somewhat-intrusive":"6"}}},"Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission19\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission19\/altPolicy2.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission19\/altPolicy3.json"],"altPolicy2.json":{"collision":"1","travelTime":"130","intrusiveness":{"Value":"5","Event-based Values":{"non-intrusive":"7","very-intrusive":"0","somewhat-intrusive":"5"}}}}
