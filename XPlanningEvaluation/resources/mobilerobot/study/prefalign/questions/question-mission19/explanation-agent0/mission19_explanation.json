{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission19\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission19\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to take 177 minutes; have 0 expected collision; and have intrusiveness-penalty of 5: it will be non-intrusive at 7 locations (0-penalty), somewhat-intrusive at 5 locations (5-penalty), and very-intrusive at 0 location (0-penalty). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness, and collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission19\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the expected travel time by 14 minutes. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the expected collision by 0.2. The decrease in expected travel time is not worth the increase in expected collision.","solnPolicy.json":{"collision":"0","travelTime":"177","intrusiveness":{"Value":"5","Event-based Values":{"non-intrusive":"7","very-intrusive":"0","somewhat-intrusive":"5"}}},"Mission":"mission19.json","altPolicy1.json":{"collision":"0.2","travelTime":"163","intrusiveness":{"Value":"5","Event-based Values":{"non-intrusive":"7","very-intrusive":"0","somewhat-intrusive":"5"}}},"Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission19\/altPolicy1.json"]}
