{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission12\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission12\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.2 collision; take 173 minutes; and have intrusiveness-penalty of 10: be non-intrusive 8 steps, very-intrusive 3 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 1 step. It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission12\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0 collision. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 193 minutes. The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission12\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the time to 159 minutes. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.4 collision. The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","solnPolicy.json":{"collision":"0.2","travelTime":"173","intrusiveness":{"non-intrusive":"8","very-intrusive":"3","somewhat-intrusive":"1"}},"Mission":"mission12.json","altPolicy1.json":{"collision":"0","travelTime":"193","intrusiveness":{"non-intrusive":"8","very-intrusive":"3","somewhat-intrusive":"1"}},"Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission12\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission12\/altPolicy2.json"],"altPolicy2.json":{"collision":"0.4","travelTime":"159","intrusiveness":{"non-intrusive":"8","very-intrusive":"3","somewhat-intrusive":"1"}}}
