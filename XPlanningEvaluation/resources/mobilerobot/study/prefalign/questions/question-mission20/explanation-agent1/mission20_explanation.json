{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission20\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission20\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.0 collision (0.0 in cost); take 178.65541206668777 minutes (0.36236596251716474 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 5.0 steps, very-intrusive 0.0 step, and non-intrusive 7.0 steps (0.49999999999999994 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness, and collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission20\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 152.60519296477048 minutes (-0.052837541328586535 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to somewhat-intrusive 6.0 steps, very-intrusive 0.0 step, and non-intrusive 8.0 steps (+0.10000000000053882 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in intrusiveness.","Mission":"mission20.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission20\/altPolicy1.json"]}
