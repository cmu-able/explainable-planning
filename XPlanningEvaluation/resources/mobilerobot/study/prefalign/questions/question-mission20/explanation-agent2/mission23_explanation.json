{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission23\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission23\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.0 collision (0.0 in cost); take 152.60519296456872 minutes (1.238113684752676 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 6.0 steps, very-intrusive 0.0 step, and non-intrusive 8.0 steps (0.39999999999999997 in cost). It has the lowest expected collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission23\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the intrusiveness to somewhat-intrusive 5.0 steps, very-intrusive 0.0 step, and non-intrusive 7.0 steps (-0.06666666666672111 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 153.61678045825965 minutes (+0.00820719331323283 in cost), and increase the collision to 0.3999999999999183 collision (+0.15999999999996734 in cost). The decrease in intrusiveness is not worth the increase in time, and the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission23\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the time to 145.25964585374197 minutes (-0.05959575964116559 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.19999999999965903 collision (+0.07999999999986362 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission23.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission23\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission23\/altPolicy2.json"]}
