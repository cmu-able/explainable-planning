{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission20\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission20\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to take 179 minutes; have 0 collision; and have intrusiveness-penalty of 5: be non-intrusive 7 steps, somewhat-intrusive 5 steps, and very-intrusive 0 step. It has the lowest expected collision, and intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission20\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the travel time to 153 minutes. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to 6: non-intrusive 8 steps, somewhat-intrusive 6 steps, and very-intrusive 0 step. The decrease in travel time is not worth the increase in intrusiveness.","solnPolicy.json":{"collision":"0","travelTime":"179","intrusiveness":{"non-intrusive":"7","very-intrusive":"0","somewhat-intrusive":"5"}},"Mission":"mission20.json","altPolicy1.json":{"collision":"0","travelTime":"153","intrusiveness":{"non-intrusive":"8","very-intrusive":"0","somewhat-intrusive":"6"}},"Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission20\/altPolicy1.json"]}
