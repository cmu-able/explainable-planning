{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission23\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission23\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to take 153 minutes; have 0 collision; and have intrusiveness-penalty of 6: be non-intrusive 8 steps, somewhat-intrusive 6 steps, and very-intrusive 0 step. It has the lowest expected collision, and intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission23\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the travel time to 145 minutes. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.2 collision. The decrease in travel time is not worth the increase in collision.","solnPolicy.json":{"collision":"0","travelTime":"153","intrusiveness":{"non-intrusive":"8","very-intrusive":"0","somewhat-intrusive":"6"}},"Mission":"mission23.json","altPolicy1.json":{"collision":"0.2","travelTime":"145","intrusiveness":{"non-intrusive":"8","very-intrusive":"0","somewhat-intrusive":"6"}},"Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission23\/altPolicy1.json"]}
