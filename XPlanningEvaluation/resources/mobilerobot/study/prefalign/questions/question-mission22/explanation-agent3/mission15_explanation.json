{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission15\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission15\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.39999999999999997 collision (0.08 in cost); take 153.6167804583472 minutes (0.6231604390333093 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 5.0 steps, very-intrusive 0.0 step, and non-intrusive 7.0 steps (0.9999999999999999 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission15\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.1999999999996859 collision (-0.04000000000006282 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 164.80929122013083 minutes (+0.04540343769337973 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission15\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the time to 144.56131546580698 minutes (-0.03673431719871367 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.5999999999993701 collision (+0.03999999999987404 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission15.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission15\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission15\/altPolicy2.json"]}
