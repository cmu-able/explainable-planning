{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission16\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission16\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to take 130 minutes; have 1 collision; and have intrusiveness-penalty of 5: be non-intrusive 7 steps, somewhat-intrusive 5 steps, and very-intrusive 0 step. It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission16\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the travel time to 127 minutes, and reduce the collision to 0.6 collision. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to 6: non-intrusive 8 steps, somewhat-intrusive 6 steps, and very-intrusive 0 step. The decrease in travel time, and the decrease in collision are not worth the increase in intrusiveness.","solnPolicy.json":{"collision":"1","travelTime":"130","intrusiveness":{"non-intrusive":"7","very-intrusive":"0","somewhat-intrusive":"5"}},"Mission":"mission16.json","altPolicy1.json":{"collision":"0.6","travelTime":"127","intrusiveness":{"non-intrusive":"8","very-intrusive":"0","somewhat-intrusive":"6"}},"Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission16\/altPolicy1.json"]}
