  <p>I'm planning to follow this policy (see Figure 1). It is expected to have 0.6 collision; take 127 minutes; and have intrusiveness-penalty of 6: be non-intrusive 8 steps, somewhat-intrusive 6 steps, and very-intrusive 0 step. It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.</p>

  <p>Alternatively, following this policy (see Figure 2) would reduce the collision to 0.4 collision. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 134 minutes. The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.</p>
