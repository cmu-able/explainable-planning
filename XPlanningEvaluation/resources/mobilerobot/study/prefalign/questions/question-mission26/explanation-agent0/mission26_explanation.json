{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission26\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission26\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to take 126 minutes; have 1 collision; and have intrusiveness-penalty of 7: it will be non-intrusive at 5 locations (0-penalty), somewhat-intrusive at 7 locations (7-penalty), and very-intrusive at 0 location (0-penalty).\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission26\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.6 collision. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the travel time to 137 minutes. The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in travel time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission26\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the intrusiveness to 6: non-intrusive at 6 locations (0-penalty), somewhat-intrusive at 6 locations (6-penalty), and very-intrusive at 0 location (0-penalty). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 1.4 collisions, and increase the travel time to 134 minutes. The decrease in intrusiveness is not worth the increase in collision, and the increase in travel time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission26\/altPolicy3.json] would reduce the travel time to 125 minutes. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 1.6 collisions, and increase the intrusiveness to 14: non-intrusive at 5 locations (0-penalty), somewhat-intrusive at 5 locations (5-penalty), and very-intrusive at 3 locations (9-penalty). The decrease in travel time is not worth the increase in collision, and the increase in intrusiveness.","solnPolicy.json":{"collision":"1","travelTime":"126","intrusiveness":{"Value":"7","Event-based Values":{"non-intrusive":"5","very-intrusive":"0","somewhat-intrusive":"7"}}},"Mission":"mission26.json","altPolicy1.json":{"collision":"0.6","travelTime":"137","intrusiveness":{"Value":"7","Event-based Values":{"non-intrusive":"5","very-intrusive":"0","somewhat-intrusive":"7"}}},"altPolicy3.json":{"collision":"1.6","travelTime":"125","intrusiveness":{"Value":"14","Event-based Values":{"non-intrusive":"5","very-intrusive":"3","somewhat-intrusive":"5"}}},"Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission26\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission26\/altPolicy2.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission26\/altPolicy3.json"],"altPolicy2.json":{"collision":"1.4","travelTime":"134","intrusiveness":{"Value":"6","Event-based Values":{"non-intrusive":"6","very-intrusive":"0","somewhat-intrusive":"6"}}}}
