{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission33\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission33\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to take 160 minutes; have 0 collision; and have intrusiveness-penalty of 7: be non-intrusive 5 steps, somewhat-intrusive 7 steps, and very-intrusive 0 step. It has the lowest expected collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission33\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the travel time to 149 minutes. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.2 collision. The decrease in travel time is not worth the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission33\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the intrusiveness to 6: non-intrusive 6 steps, somewhat-intrusive 6 steps, and very-intrusive 0 step. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the travel time to 183 minutes. The decrease in intrusiveness is not worth the increase in travel time.","solnPolicy.json":{"collision":"0","travelTime":"160","intrusiveness":{"non-intrusive":"5","very-intrusive":"0","somewhat-intrusive":"7"}},"Mission":"mission33.json","altPolicy1.json":{"collision":"0.2","travelTime":"149","intrusiveness":{"non-intrusive":"5","very-intrusive":"0","somewhat-intrusive":"7"}},"Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission33\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission33\/altPolicy2.json"],"altPolicy2.json":{"collision":"0","travelTime":"183","intrusiveness":{"non-intrusive":"6","very-intrusive":"0","somewhat-intrusive":"6"}}}
