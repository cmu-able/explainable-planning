  <p>I'm planning to follow this policy (see Figure 1). It is expected to have 1.2 collisions; take 131 minutes; and have intrusiveness-penalty of 10: be non-intrusive 8 steps, very-intrusive 3 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 1 step. It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.</p>

  <p>Alternatively, following this policy (see Figure 2) would reduce the collision to 1 collision. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 137 minutes. The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.</p>
