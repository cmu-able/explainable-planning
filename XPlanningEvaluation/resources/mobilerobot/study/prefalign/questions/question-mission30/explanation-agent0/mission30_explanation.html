  <p>I'm planning to follow this policy (see "Agent's Policy" figure). It is expected to take 126 minutes; have 1 expected collision; and have intrusiveness-penalty of 7: it will be non-intrusive at 5 locations (0-penalty), somewhat-intrusive at 7 locations (7-penalty), and very-intrusive at 0 location (0-penalty).</p>

  <p>Alternatively, following this policy (see "Alternative Policy 1" figure) would reduce the expected travel time by 1 minute. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the expected collision by 0.6, and increase the expected intrusiveness by 7: it would be non-intrusive at 5 locations (0-penalty), somewhat-intrusive at 5 locations (5-penalty), and very-intrusive at 3 locations (9-penalty). The decrease in expected travel time is not worth the increase in expected collision, and the increase in expected intrusiveness.</p>
