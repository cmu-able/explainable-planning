   I'm planning to follow this policy <img src="solnPolicy.png" width="500" height="1064">. It is expected to have 0 collision; take 218 minutes; and have intrusiveness-penalty of 4: be non-intrusive 11 steps, somewhat-intrusive 4 steps, and very-intrusive 0 step. It has the lowest expected intrusiveness, and collision. Alternatively, following this policy <img src="altPolicy1.png" width="500" height="1064"> would reduce the time to 211 minutes. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.2 collision. The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.
