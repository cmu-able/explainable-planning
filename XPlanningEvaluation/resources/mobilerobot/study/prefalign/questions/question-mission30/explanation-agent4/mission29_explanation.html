   I'm planning to follow this policy <img src="solnPolicy.png" width="500" height="1064">. It is expected to have 0.6 collision; take 196 minutes; and have intrusiveness-penalty of 4: be non-intrusive 11 steps, somewhat-intrusive 4 steps, and very-intrusive 0 step. It has the lowest expected intrusiveness. Alternatively, following this policy <img src="altPolicy1.png" width="500" height="1064"> would reduce the collision to 0.4 collision. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 203 minutes. The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time. Alternatively, following this policy <img src="altPolicy2.png" width="500" height="1064"> would reduce the time to 192 minutes. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.8 collision. The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.
