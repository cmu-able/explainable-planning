{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission37\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission37\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to take 160 minutes; have 0 expected collision; and have intrusiveness-penalty of 7: it will be non-intrusive at 5 locations (0-penalty), somewhat-intrusive at 7 locations (7-penalty), and very-intrusive at 0 location (0-penalty). It has the lowest expected collision, and intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission37\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the expected travel time by 11 minutes. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the expected collision by 0.2. The decrease in expected travel time is not worth the increase in expected collision.","solnPolicy.json":{"collision":"0","travelTime":"160","intrusiveness":{"Value":"7","Event-based Values":{"non-intrusive":"5","very-intrusive":"0","somewhat-intrusive":"7"}}},"Mission":"mission37.json","altPolicy1.json":{"collision":"0.2","travelTime":"149","intrusiveness":{"Value":"7","Event-based Values":{"non-intrusive":"5","very-intrusive":"0","somewhat-intrusive":"7"}}},"Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission37\/altPolicy1.json"]}
