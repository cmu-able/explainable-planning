{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission34\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission34\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to take 113 seconds; have 1 expected collision; and have intrusiveness-penalty of 7: it will be non-intrusive at 5 locations (0-penalty), somewhat-intrusive at 7 locations (7-penalty), and very-intrusive at 0 location (0-penalty).\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission34\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the expected intrusiveness by 1: it would be non-intrusive at 6 locations (0-penalty), somewhat-intrusive at 6 locations (6-penalty), and very-intrusive at 0 location (0-penalty). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the expected travel time by 2 seconds, and increase the expected collision by 0.4. The decrease in expected intrusiveness is not worth the increase in expected travel time, and the increase in expected collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission34\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the expected travel time by 3 seconds. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the expected intrusiveness by 1: it would be non-intrusive at 7 locations (0-penalty), somewhat-intrusive at 5 locations (5-penalty), and very-intrusive at 1 location (3-penalty), and increase the expected collision by 1. The decrease in expected travel time is not worth the increase in expected intrusiveness, and the increase in expected collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission34\/altPolicy3.json] would reduce the expected collision by 0.4. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the expected travel time by 8 seconds. The decrease in expected collision is not worth the increase in expected travel time.","solnPolicy.json":{"collision":"1","travelTime":"113","intrusiveness":{"Value":"7","Event-based Values":{"non-intrusive":"5","very-intrusive":"0","somewhat-intrusive":"7"}}},"Mission":"mission34.json","altPolicy3.json":{"collision":"0.6","travelTime":"121","intrusiveness":{"Value":"7","Event-based Values":{"non-intrusive":"5","very-intrusive":"0","somewhat-intrusive":"7"}}},"altPolicy1.json":{"collision":"1.4","travelTime":"115","intrusiveness":{"Value":"6","Event-based Values":{"non-intrusive":"6","very-intrusive":"0","somewhat-intrusive":"6"}}},"Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission34\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission34\/altPolicy2.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission34\/altPolicy3.json"],"altPolicy2.json":{"collision":"2","travelTime":"110","intrusiveness":{"Value":"8","Event-based Values":{"non-intrusive":"7","very-intrusive":"1","somewhat-intrusive":"5"}}}}
