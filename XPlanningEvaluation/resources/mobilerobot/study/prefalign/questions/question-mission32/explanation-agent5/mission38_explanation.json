{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission38\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission38\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.2 collision (0.066 in cost); take 148.55603091988206 minutes (1.425896460019459 in cost); and be non-intrusive 5.0 steps, very-intrusive 0.0 step, and somewhat-intrusive 7.0 steps (0.7699999999999999 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission38\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.0 collision (-0.066 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 159.8335539923675 minutes (+0.10824589299587073 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission38\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the time to 137.53292167619 minutes (-0.10580393371888785 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.6000000000000001 collision (+0.13200000000000003 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission38.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission38\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission38\/altPolicy2.json"]}
