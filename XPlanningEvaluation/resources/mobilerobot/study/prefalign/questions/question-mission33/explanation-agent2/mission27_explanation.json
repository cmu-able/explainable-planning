{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission27\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission27\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.7999999999999998 collisions (0.18 in cost); take 160.82686632081064 minutes (1.4033423063758643 in cost); and be non-intrusive 11.0 steps, very-intrusive 0.0 step, and somewhat-intrusive 4.0 steps (0.7999999999999999 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission27\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 1.6 collisions (-0.019999999999999962 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 167.90563166952003 minutes (+0.06176785706273469 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission27\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 1.4000000000002464 collisions (-0.03999999999997536 in cost), and reduce the time to 153.0887373932317 minutes (-0.06752132864791904 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to non-intrusive 10.0 steps, very-intrusive 0.0 step, and somewhat-intrusive 5.0 steps (+0.20000000000015727 in cost). The decrease in collision, and the decrease in time are not worth the increase in intrusiveness.","Mission":"mission27.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission27\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission27\/altPolicy2.json"]}
