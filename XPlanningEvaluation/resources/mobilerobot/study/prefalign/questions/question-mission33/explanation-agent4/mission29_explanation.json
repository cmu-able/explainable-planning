{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission29\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission29\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to take 196 minutes; have 0.6 collision; and have intrusiveness-penalty of 4: be non-intrusive 11 steps, somewhat-intrusive 4 steps, and very-intrusive 0 step. It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission29\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.4 collision. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the travel time to 203 minutes. The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in travel time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission29\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the travel time to 192 minutes. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.8 collision. The decrease in travel time is not worth the increase in collision.","solnPolicy.json":{"collision":"0.6","travelTime":"196","intrusiveness":{"non-intrusive":"11","very-intrusive":"0","somewhat-intrusive":"4"}},"Mission":"mission29.json","altPolicy1.json":{"collision":"0.4","travelTime":"203","intrusiveness":{"non-intrusive":"11","very-intrusive":"0","somewhat-intrusive":"4"}},"Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission29\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission29\/altPolicy2.json"],"altPolicy2.json":{"collision":"0.8","travelTime":"192","intrusiveness":{"non-intrusive":"11","very-intrusive":"0","somewhat-intrusive":"4"}}}
