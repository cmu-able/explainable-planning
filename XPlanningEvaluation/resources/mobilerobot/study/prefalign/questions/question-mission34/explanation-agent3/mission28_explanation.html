   I'm planning to follow this policy <img src="solnPolicy.png" width="500" height="1064">. It is expected to have 1 collision; take 126 minutes; and have intrusiveness-penalty of 7: be somewhat-intrusive 7 steps, non-intrusive 5 steps, and very-intrusive 0 step. Alternatively, following this policy <img src="altPolicy1.png" width="500" height="1064"> would reduce the collision to 0.6 collision. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 137 minutes. The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time. Alternatively, following this policy <img src="altPolicy2.png" width="500" height="1064"> would reduce the time to 125 minutes. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to 14: non-intrusive 5 steps, somewhat-intrusive 5 steps, and very-intrusive 3 steps, and increase the collision to 1.6 collisions. The decrease in time is not worth the increase in intrusiveness, and the increase in collision. Alternatively, following this policy <img src="altPolicy3.png" width="500" height="1064"> would reduce the intrusiveness to 6: non-intrusive 6 steps, somewhat-intrusive 6 steps, and very-intrusive 0 step. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 1.4 collisions, and increase the time to 134 minutes. The decrease in intrusiveness is not worth the increase in collision, and the increase in time.
