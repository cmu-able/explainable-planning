{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission38\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission38\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to take 149 minutes; have 0.2 collision; and have intrusiveness-penalty of 7: be non-intrusive 5 steps, somewhat-intrusive 7 steps, and very-intrusive 0 step.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission38\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the travel time to 138 minutes. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.6 collision. The decrease in travel time is not worth the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission38\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the intrusiveness to 6: non-intrusive 6 steps, somewhat-intrusive 6 steps, and very-intrusive 0 step. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.6 collision, and increase the travel time to 156 minutes. The decrease in intrusiveness is not worth the increase in collision, and the increase in travel time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission38\/altPolicy3.json] would reduce the collision to 0 collision. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the travel time to 160 minutes. The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in travel time.","solnPolicy.json":{"collision":"0.2","travelTime":"149","intrusiveness":{"non-intrusive":"5","very-intrusive":"0","somewhat-intrusive":"7"}},"Mission":"mission38.json","altPolicy3.json":{"collision":"0","travelTime":"160","intrusiveness":{"non-intrusive":"5","very-intrusive":"0","somewhat-intrusive":"7"}},"altPolicy1.json":{"collision":"0.6","travelTime":"138","intrusiveness":{"non-intrusive":"5","very-intrusive":"0","somewhat-intrusive":"7"}},"Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission38\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission38\/altPolicy2.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission38\/altPolicy3.json"],"altPolicy2.json":{"collision":"0.6","travelTime":"156","intrusiveness":{"non-intrusive":"6","very-intrusive":"0","somewhat-intrusive":"6"}}}
