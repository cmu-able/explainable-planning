{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission36\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission36\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.0 collision (0.0 in cost); take 218.04737565191465 minutes (1.2684245033047994 in cost); and be non-intrusive 11.0 steps, very-intrusive 0.0 step, and somewhat-intrusive 4.0 steps (0.5333333333333333 in cost). It has the lowest expected collision, and intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission36\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 210.96861030334003 minutes (-0.04117857137437242 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.2 collision (+0.08000000000000002 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission36.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission36\/altPolicy1.json"]}
