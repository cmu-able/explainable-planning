{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission29\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission29\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.6000000000000001 collision (0.12000000000000002 in cost); take 196.02562938120244 minutes (1.1403196706196133 in cost); and be non-intrusive 11.0 steps, very-intrusive 0.0 step, and somewhat-intrusive 4.0 steps (0.7999999999999999 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission29\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.4 collision (-0.04000000000000001 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 203.10439472992005 minutes (+0.0411785713752042 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission29\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the time to 192.08128548620297 minutes (-0.022945024818206594 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.8 collision (+0.04000000000000001 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission29.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission29\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission29\/altPolicy2.json"]}
