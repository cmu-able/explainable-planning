{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission33\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission33\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.0 collision (0.0 in cost); take 159.8335539926903 minutes (1.3946748663803892 in cost); and be non-intrusive 5.0 steps, very-intrusive 0.0 step, and somewhat-intrusive 7.0 steps (0.2333333333333333 in cost). It has the lowest expected collision, and intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission33\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 148.5560309197184 minutes (-0.09840535727321775 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.19999999999966694 collision (+0.11999999999980016 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission33.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission33\/altPolicy1.json"]}
