  <p>I'm planning to follow this policy (see Figure 1). It is expected to have 1 collision; take 126 minutes; and have intrusiveness-penalty of 7: be somewhat-intrusive 7 steps, non-intrusive 5 steps, and very-intrusive 0 step.</p>

  <p>Alternatively, following this policy (see Figure 2) would reduce the collision to 0.6 collision. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 137 minutes. The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.</p>
