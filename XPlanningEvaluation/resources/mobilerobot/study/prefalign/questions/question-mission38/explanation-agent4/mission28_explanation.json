{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission28\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission28\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to take 126 minutes; have 1 expected collision; and have intrusiveness-penalty of 7: it will be non-intrusive at 5 locations (0-penalty), somewhat-intrusive at 7 locations (7-penalty), and very-intrusive at 0 location (0-penalty).\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission28\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the expected collision by 0.4. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the expected travel time by 11 minutes. The decrease in expected collision is not worth the increase in expected travel time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission28\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the expected travel time by 1 minute. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the expected intrusiveness by 7: it would be non-intrusive at 5 locations (0-penalty), somewhat-intrusive at 5 locations (5-penalty), and very-intrusive at 3 locations (9-penalty), and increase the expected collision by 0.6. The decrease in expected travel time is not worth the increase in expected intrusiveness, and the increase in expected collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission28\/altPolicy3.json] would reduce the expected intrusiveness by 1: it would be non-intrusive at 6 locations (0-penalty), somewhat-intrusive at 6 locations (6-penalty), and very-intrusive at 0 location (0-penalty). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the expected collision by 0.4, and increase the expected travel time by 8 minutes. The decrease in expected intrusiveness is not worth the increase in expected collision, and the increase in expected travel time.","solnPolicy.json":{"collision":"1","travelTime":"126","intrusiveness":{"Value":"7","Event-based Values":{"non-intrusive":"5","very-intrusive":"0","somewhat-intrusive":"7"}}},"Mission":"mission28.json","altPolicy1.json":{"collision":"0.6","travelTime":"137","intrusiveness":{"Value":"7","Event-based Values":{"non-intrusive":"5","very-intrusive":"0","somewhat-intrusive":"7"}}},"altPolicy3.json":{"collision":"1.4","travelTime":"134","intrusiveness":{"Value":"6","Event-based Values":{"non-intrusive":"6","very-intrusive":"0","somewhat-intrusive":"6"}}},"Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission28\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission28\/altPolicy2.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission28\/altPolicy3.json"],"altPolicy2.json":{"collision":"1.6","travelTime":"125","intrusiveness":{"Value":"14","Event-based Values":{"non-intrusive":"5","very-intrusive":"3","somewhat-intrusive":"5"}}}}
