{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission40\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission40\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to take 153 minutes; have 1.4 collisions; and have intrusiveness-penalty of 5: be non-intrusive 12 steps, somewhat-intrusive 2 steps, and very-intrusive 1 step. It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission40\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the travel time to 151 minutes, and reduce the collision to 1 collision. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to 6: non-intrusive 10 steps, somewhat-intrusive 0 step, and very-intrusive 2 steps. The decrease in travel time, and the decrease in collision are not worth the increase in intrusiveness.","solnPolicy.json":{"collision":"1.4","travelTime":"153","intrusiveness":{"non-intrusive":"12","very-intrusive":"1","somewhat-intrusive":"2"}},"Mission":"mission40.json","altPolicy1.json":{"collision":"1","travelTime":"151","intrusiveness":{"non-intrusive":"10","very-intrusive":"2","somewhat-intrusive":"0"}},"Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission40\/altPolicy1.json"]}
