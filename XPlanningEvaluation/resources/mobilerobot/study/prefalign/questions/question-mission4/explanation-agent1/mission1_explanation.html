   I'm planning to follow this policy <img src="solnPolicy.png" width="500" height="1064">. It is expected to have 1.2 collisions; take 131 minutes; and have intrusiveness-penalty of 10: be non-intrusive 8 steps, very-intrusive 3 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 1 step. It has the lowest expected intrusiveness. Alternatively, following this policy <img src="altPolicy1.png" width="500" height="1064"> would reduce the collision to 1 collision. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 137 minutes. The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time. Alternatively, following this policy <img src="altPolicy2.png" width="500" height="1064"> would reduce the time to 127 minutes. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to 13: non-intrusive 8 steps, very-intrusive 4 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 1 step, and increase the collision to 1.4 collisions. The decrease in time is not worth the increase in intrusiveness, and the increase in collision.
