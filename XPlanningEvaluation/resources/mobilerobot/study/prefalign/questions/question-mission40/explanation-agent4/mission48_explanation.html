  <p>I'm planning to follow this policy (see Figure 1). It is expected to have 0 collision; take 170 minutes; and have intrusiveness-penalty of 8: be non-intrusive 6 steps, somewhat-intrusive 5 steps, and very-intrusive 1 step. It has the lowest expected collision, and intrusiveness.</p>

  <p>Alternatively, following this policy (see Figure 2) would reduce the time to 160 minutes. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.2 collision. The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.</p>
