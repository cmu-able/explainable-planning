{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission48\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission48\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.0 collision (0.0 in cost); take 169.79901613657478 minutes (1.2915096554805896 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 5.0 steps, very-intrusive 1.0 step, and non-intrusive 6.0 steps (0.26666666666666666 in cost). It has the lowest expected collision, and intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission48\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 160.4280402964554 minutes (-0.07127665433028696 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.20000000000008292 collision (+0.12000000000004975 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission48.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission48\/altPolicy1.json"]}
