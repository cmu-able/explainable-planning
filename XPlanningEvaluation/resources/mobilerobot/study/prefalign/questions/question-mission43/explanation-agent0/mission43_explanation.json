{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission43\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission43\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to take 129 minutes; have 1.2 collisions; and have intrusiveness-penalty of 8: it will be non-intrusive at 6 locations (0-penalty), somewhat-intrusive at 5 locations (5-penalty), and very-intrusive at 1 location (3-penalty). It has the lowest expected travel time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission43\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the intrusiveness to 6: non-intrusive at 10 locations (0-penalty), somewhat-intrusive at 0 location (0-penalty), and very-intrusive at 2 locations (6-penalty). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the travel time to 133 minutes, and increase the collision to 1.6 collisions. The decrease in intrusiveness is not worth the increase in travel time, and the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission43\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 1 collision. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the travel time to 134 minutes. The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in travel time.","solnPolicy.json":{"collision":"1.2","travelTime":"129","intrusiveness":{"Value":"8","Event-based Values":{"non-intrusive":"6","very-intrusive":"1","somewhat-intrusive":"5"}}},"Mission":"mission43.json","altPolicy1.json":{"collision":"1.6","travelTime":"133","intrusiveness":{"Value":"6","Event-based Values":{"non-intrusive":"10","very-intrusive":"2","somewhat-intrusive":"0"}}},"Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission43\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission43\/altPolicy2.json"],"altPolicy2.json":{"collision":"1","travelTime":"134","intrusiveness":{"Value":"8","Event-based Values":{"non-intrusive":"6","very-intrusive":"1","somewhat-intrusive":"5"}}}}
