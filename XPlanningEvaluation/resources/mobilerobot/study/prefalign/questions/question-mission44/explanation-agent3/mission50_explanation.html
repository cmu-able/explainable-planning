  <p>I'm planning to follow this policy (see Figure 1). It is expected to have 1.6 collisions; take 133 minutes; and have intrusiveness-penalty of 6: be non-intrusive 10 steps, very-intrusive 2 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 0 step.</p>

  <p>Alternatively, following this policy (see Figure 2) would reduce the time to 129 minutes, and reduce the collision to 1.2 collisions. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to 8: non-intrusive 6 steps, somewhat-intrusive 5 steps, and very-intrusive 1 step. The decrease in time, and the decrease in collision are not worth the increase in intrusiveness.</p>
