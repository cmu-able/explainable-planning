{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission33\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission33\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to take 138 seconds; have 1.8 expected collisions; and have intrusiveness-penalty of 4: it will be non-intrusive at 11 locations (0-penalty), somewhat-intrusive at 4 locations (4-penalty), and very-intrusive at 0 location (0-penalty). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission33\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the expected travel time by 2 seconds, and reduce the expected collision by 0.4. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the expected intrusiveness by 1: it would be non-intrusive at 10 locations (0-penalty), somewhat-intrusive at 5 locations (5-penalty), and very-intrusive at 0 location (0-penalty). The decrease in expected travel time, and the decrease in expected collision are not worth the increase in expected intrusiveness.","solnPolicy.json":{"collision":"1.8","travelTime":"138","intrusiveness":{"Value":"4","Event-based Values":{"non-intrusive":"11","very-intrusive":"0","somewhat-intrusive":"4"}}},"Mission":"mission33.json","altPolicy1.json":{"collision":"1.4","travelTime":"135","intrusiveness":{"Value":"5","Event-based Values":{"non-intrusive":"10","very-intrusive":"0","somewhat-intrusive":"5"}}},"Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission33\/altPolicy1.json"]}
