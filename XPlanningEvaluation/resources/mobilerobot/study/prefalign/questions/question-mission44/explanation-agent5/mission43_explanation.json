{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission43\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission43\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.2 collisions (0.24 in cost); take 128.58891077421967 minutes (1.9561222865868464 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 5.0 steps, very-intrusive 1.0 step, and non-intrusive 6.0 steps (0.5333333333333333 in cost). It has the lowest expected time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission43\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the intrusiveness to somewhat-intrusive 0.0 step, very-intrusive 2.0 steps, and non-intrusive 10.0 steps (-0.1333333333333333 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 1.5999999999999999 collisions (+0.08000000000000002 in cost), and increase the time to 133.03528400038002 minutes (+0.06763918995664309 in cost). The decrease in intrusiveness is not worth the increase in collision, and the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission43\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 1.0000000000006024 collisions (-0.03999999999987949 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 134.37667610522772 minutes (+0.08804473640342358 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission43.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission43\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission43\/altPolicy2.json"]}
