It is expected to have 0.2 collision (0.08000000000000002 in cost); take 160.42804029662489 minutes (1.6269773348687888 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 5.0 steps, very-intrusive 1.0 step, and non-intrusive 6.0 steps (0.5333333333333333 in cost).\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission49\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.0 collision (-0.08000000000000002 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 169.79901613659533 minutes (+0.09503553910553908 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission49\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the time to 150.95044928082575 minutes (-0.09611677449497336 in cost), and reduce the intrusiveness to somewhat-intrusive 0.0 step, very-intrusive 2.0 steps, and non-intrusive 10.0 steps (-0.13333333333329922 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 1.0000000000009468 collisions (+0.3200000000003787 in cost). The decrease in time, and the decrease in intrusiveness are not worth the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission49\/altPolicy3.json] would reduce the time to 155.83933046213997 minutes (-0.04653629679196136 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.4 collision (+0.08000000000000002 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission49.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission49\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission49\/altPolicy2.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission49\/altPolicy3.json"]}
