    <p>I'm planning to follow this policy (see "Agent's Policy" figure). It is expected to take 133 minutes; have 1.6 expected collisions; and have intrusiveness-penalty of 6: it will be non-intrusive at 10 locations (0-penalty), somewhat-intrusive at 0 location (0-penalty), and very-intrusive at 2 locations (6-penalty).</p>

    <p>Alternatively, following this policy (see "Alternative Policy 1" figure) would reduce the expected travel time by 4 minutes, and reduce the expected collision by 0.4. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the expected intrusiveness by 2: it would be non-intrusive at 6 locations (0-penalty), somewhat-intrusive at 5 locations (5-penalty), and very-intrusive at 1 location (3-penalty). The decrease in expected travel time, and the decrease in expected collision are not worth the increase in expected intrusiveness.</p>
