{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission43\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission43\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to take 188 seconds; have 0 expected collision; and have intrusiveness-penalty of 5: it will be non-intrusive at 12 locations (0-penalty), somewhat-intrusive at 2 locations (2-penalty), and very-intrusive at 1 location (3-penalty). It has the lowest expected collision, and intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission43\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the expected travel time by 7 seconds. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the expected intrusiveness by 1: it would be non-intrusive at 10 locations (0-penalty), somewhat-intrusive at 0 location (0-penalty), and very-intrusive at 2 locations (6-penalty). The decrease in expected travel time is not worth the increase in expected intrusiveness.","solnPolicy.json":{"collision":"0","travelTime":"188","intrusiveness":{"Value":"5","Event-based Values":{"non-intrusive":"12","very-intrusive":"1","somewhat-intrusive":"2"}}},"Mission":"mission43.json","altPolicy1.json":{"collision":"0","travelTime":"182","intrusiveness":{"Value":"6","Event-based Values":{"non-intrusive":"10","very-intrusive":"2","somewhat-intrusive":"0"}}},"Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission43\/altPolicy1.json"]}
