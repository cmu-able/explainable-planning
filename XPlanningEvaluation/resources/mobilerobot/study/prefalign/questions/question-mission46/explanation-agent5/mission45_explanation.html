  <p>I'm planning to follow this policy (see Figure 1). It is expected to take 129 minutes; have 1.2 collisions; and have intrusiveness-penalty of 8: it will be non-intrusive at 6 locations (0-penalty), somewhat-intrusive at 5 locations (5-penalty), and very-intrusive at 1 location (3-penalty). It has the lowest expected travel time.</p>

  <p>Alternatively, following this policy (see Figure 2) would reduce the intrusiveness to 6: non-intrusive at 10 locations (0-penalty), somewhat-intrusive at 0 location (0-penalty), and very-intrusive at 2 locations (6-penalty). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the travel time to 133 minutes, and increase the collision to 1.6 collisions. The decrease in intrusiveness is not worth the increase in travel time, and the increase in collision.</p>
