  <p>I'm planning to follow this policy (see Figure 1). It is expected to take 153 minutes; have 1.4 collisions; and have intrusiveness-penalty of 5: be non-intrusive 12 steps, somewhat-intrusive 2 steps, and very-intrusive 1 step. It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.</p>

  <p>Alternatively, following this policy (see Figure 2) would reduce the travel time to 151 minutes, and reduce the collision to 1 collision. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to 6: non-intrusive 10 steps, somewhat-intrusive 0 step, and very-intrusive 2 steps. The decrease in travel time, and the decrease in collision are not worth the increase in intrusiveness.</p>
