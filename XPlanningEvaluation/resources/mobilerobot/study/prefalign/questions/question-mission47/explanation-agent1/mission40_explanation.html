  <p>I'm planning to follow this policy (see Figure 1). It is expected to take 153 minutes; have 1.4 collisions; and have intrusiveness-penalty of 5: it will be non-intrusive at 12 locations (0-penalty), somewhat-intrusive at 2 locations (2-penalty), and very-intrusive at 1 location (3-penalty). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.</p>

  <p>Alternatively, following this policy (see Figure 2) would reduce the travel time to 151 minutes, and reduce the collision to 1 collision. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to 6: non-intrusive at 10 locations (0-penalty), somewhat-intrusive at 0 location (0-penalty), and very-intrusive at 2 locations (6-penalty). The decrease in travel time, and the decrease in collision are not worth the increase in intrusiveness.</p>
