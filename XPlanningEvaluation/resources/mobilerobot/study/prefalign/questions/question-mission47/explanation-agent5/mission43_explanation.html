  <p>I'm planning to follow this policy (see Figure 1). It is expected to take 129 minutes; have 1.2 collisions; and have intrusiveness-penalty of 8: be non-intrusive 6 steps, somewhat-intrusive 5 steps, and very-intrusive 1 step. It has the lowest expected travel time, and intrusiveness.</p>

  <p>Alternatively, following this policy (see Figure 2) would reduce the collision to 1 collision. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the travel time to 134 minutes. The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in travel time.</p>
