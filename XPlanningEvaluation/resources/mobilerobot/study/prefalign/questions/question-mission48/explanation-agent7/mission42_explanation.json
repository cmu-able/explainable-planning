{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission42\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission42\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to take 113 seconds; have 1.2 expected collisions; and have intrusiveness-penalty of 8: it will be non-intrusive at 6 locations (0-penalty), somewhat-intrusive at 5 locations (5-penalty), and very-intrusive at 1 location (3-penalty).\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission42\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the expected collision by 0.2. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the expected travel time by 5 seconds. The decrease in expected collision is not worth the increase in expected travel time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission42\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the expected travel time by 0 second, and reduce the expected intrusiveness by 2: it would be non-intrusive at 10 locations (0-penalty), somewhat-intrusive at 0 location (0-penalty), and very-intrusive at 2 locations (6-penalty). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the expected collision by 0.4. The decrease in expected travel time, and the decrease in expected intrusiveness are not worth the increase in expected collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission42\/altPolicy3.json] would reduce the expected travel time by 2 seconds. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the expected collision by 0.2. The decrease in expected travel time is not worth the increase in expected collision.","solnPolicy.json":{"collision":"1.2","travelTime":"113","intrusiveness":{"Value":"8","Event-based Values":{"non-intrusive":"6","very-intrusive":"1","somewhat-intrusive":"5"}}},"Mission":"mission42.json","altPolicy3.json":{"collision":"1.4","travelTime":"111","intrusiveness":{"Value":"8","Event-based Values":{"non-intrusive":"6","very-intrusive":"1","somewhat-intrusive":"5"}}},"altPolicy1.json":{"collision":"1","travelTime":"118","intrusiveness":{"Value":"8","Event-based Values":{"non-intrusive":"6","very-intrusive":"1","somewhat-intrusive":"5"}}},"Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission42\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission42\/altPolicy2.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission42\/altPolicy3.json"],"altPolicy2.json":{"collision":"1.6","travelTime":"113","intrusiveness":{"Value":"6","Event-based Values":{"non-intrusive":"10","very-intrusive":"2","somewhat-intrusive":"0"}}}}
