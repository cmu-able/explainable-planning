{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission58\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission58\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to take 111 seconds; have 1.4 expected collisions; and have intrusiveness-penalty of 8: it will be non-intrusive at 6 locations (0-penalty), somewhat-intrusive at 5 locations (5-penalty), and very-intrusive at 1 location (3-penalty).\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission58\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the expected collision by 0.2. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the expected travel time by 2 seconds. The decrease in expected collision is not worth the increase in expected travel time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission58\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the expected travel time by 3 seconds. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the expected collision by 0.8, and increase the expected intrusiveness by 6: it would be non-intrusive at 5 locations (0-penalty), somewhat-intrusive at 5 locations (5-penalty), and very-intrusive at 3 locations (9-penalty). The decrease in expected travel time is not worth the increase in expected collision, and the increase in expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission58\/altPolicy3.json] would reduce the expected intrusiveness by 2: it would be non-intrusive at 10 locations (0-penalty), somewhat-intrusive at 0 location (0-penalty), and very-intrusive at 2 locations (6-penalty). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the expected collision by 0.2, and increase the expected travel time by 2 seconds. The decrease in expected intrusiveness is not worth the increase in expected collision, and the increase in expected travel time.","solnPolicy.json":{"collision":"1.4","travelTime":"111","intrusiveness":{"Value":"8","Event-based Values":{"non-intrusive":"6","very-intrusive":"1","somewhat-intrusive":"5"}}},"Mission":"mission58.json","altPolicy1.json":{"collision":"1.2","travelTime":"113","intrusiveness":{"Value":"8","Event-based Values":{"non-intrusive":"6","very-intrusive":"1","somewhat-intrusive":"5"}}},"altPolicy3.json":{"collision":"1.6","travelTime":"113","intrusiveness":{"Value":"6","Event-based Values":{"non-intrusive":"10","very-intrusive":"2","somewhat-intrusive":"0"}}},"Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission58\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission58\/altPolicy2.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission58\/altPolicy3.json"],"altPolicy2.json":{"collision":"2.2","travelTime":"108","intrusiveness":{"Value":"14","Event-based Values":{"non-intrusive":"5","very-intrusive":"3","somewhat-intrusive":"5"}}}}
