{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission40\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission40\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to take 153 minutes; have 1.4 expected collisions; and have intrusiveness-penalty of 5: it will be non-intrusive at 12 locations (0-penalty), somewhat-intrusive at 2 locations (2-penalty), and very-intrusive at 1 location (3-penalty). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission40\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the expected collision by 0.4, and reduce the expected travel time by 2 minutes. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the expected intrusiveness by 1: it would be non-intrusive at 10 locations (0-penalty), somewhat-intrusive at 0 location (0-penalty), and very-intrusive at 2 locations (6-penalty). The decrease in expected collision, and the decrease in expected travel time are not worth the increase in expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission40\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the expected collision by 0.2. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the expected travel time by 6 minutes. The decrease in expected collision is not worth the increase in expected travel time.","solnPolicy.json":{"collision":"1.4","travelTime":"153","intrusiveness":{"Value":"5","Event-based Values":{"non-intrusive":"12","very-intrusive":"1","somewhat-intrusive":"2"}}},"Mission":"mission40.json","altPolicy1.json":{"collision":"1","travelTime":"151","intrusiveness":{"Value":"6","Event-based Values":{"non-intrusive":"10","very-intrusive":"2","somewhat-intrusive":"0"}}},"Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission40\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission40\/altPolicy2.json"],"altPolicy2.json":{"collision":"1.2","travelTime":"159","intrusiveness":{"Value":"5","Event-based Values":{"non-intrusive":"12","very-intrusive":"1","somewhat-intrusive":"2"}}}}
