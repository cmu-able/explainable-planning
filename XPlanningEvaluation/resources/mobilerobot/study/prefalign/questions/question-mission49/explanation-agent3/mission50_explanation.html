   I'm planning to follow this policy <img src="solnPolicy.png" width="500" height="1064">. It is expected to have 1.6 collisions; take 133 minutes; and have intrusiveness-penalty of 6: be non-intrusive 10 steps, very-intrusive 2 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 0 step. Alternatively, following this policy <img src="altPolicy1.png" width="500" height="1064"> would reduce the time to 129 minutes, and reduce the collision to 1.2 collisions. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to 8: non-intrusive 6 steps, somewhat-intrusive 5 steps, and very-intrusive 1 step. The decrease in time, and the decrease in collision are not worth the increase in intrusiveness. Alternatively, following this policy <img src="altPolicy2.png" width="500" height="1064"> would reduce the collision to 1.4 collisions, and reduce the intrusiveness to 5: non-intrusive 12 steps, somewhat-intrusive 2 steps, and very-intrusive 1 step. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 153 minutes. The decrease in collision, and the decrease in intrusiveness are not worth the increase in time.
