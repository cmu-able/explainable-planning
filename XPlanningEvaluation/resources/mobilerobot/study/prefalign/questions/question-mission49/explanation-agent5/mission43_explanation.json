{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission43\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission43\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.2 collisions; take 129 minutes; and have intrusiveness-penalty of 8: be non-intrusive 6 steps, somewhat-intrusive 5 steps, and very-intrusive 1 step. It has the lowest expected time, and intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission43\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 1 collision. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 134 minutes. The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","solnPolicy.json":{"collision":"1.2","travelTime":"129","intrusiveness":{"non-intrusive":"6","very-intrusive":"1","somewhat-intrusive":"5"}},"Mission":"mission43.json","altPolicy1.json":{"collision":"1","travelTime":"134","intrusiveness":{"non-intrusive":"6","very-intrusive":"1","somewhat-intrusive":"5"}},"Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission43\/altPolicy1.json"]}
