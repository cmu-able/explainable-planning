{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission1\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission1\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.2 collisions; take 131 minutes; and have intrusiveness-penalty of 10: be non-intrusive 8 steps, very-intrusive 3 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 1 step. It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission1\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 1 collision. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 137 minutes. The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission1\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the time to 127 minutes. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to 13: non-intrusive 8 steps, very-intrusive 4 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 1 step, and increase the collision to 1.4 collisions. The decrease in time is not worth the increase in intrusiveness, and the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission1.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission1\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission1\/altPolicy2.json"]}
