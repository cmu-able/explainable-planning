{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission2\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission2\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to take 131 minutes; have 1.2 expected collisions; and have intrusiveness-penalty of 10: it will be non-intrusive at 8 locations (0-penalty), somewhat-intrusive at 1 location (1-penalty), and very-intrusive at 3 locations (9-penalty). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission2\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the expected collision by 0.2. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the expected travel time by 6 minutes. The decrease in expected collision is not worth the increase in expected travel time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission2\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the expected travel time by 4 minutes. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the expected intrusiveness by 3: it would be non-intrusive at 8 locations (0-penalty), somewhat-intrusive at 1 location (1-penalty), and very-intrusive at 4 locations (12-penalty), and increase the expected collision by 0.2. The decrease in expected travel time is not worth the increase in expected intrusiveness, and the increase in expected collision.","solnPolicy.json":{"collision":"1.2","travelTime":"131","intrusiveness":{"Value":"10","Event-based Values":{"non-intrusive":"8","very-intrusive":"3","somewhat-intrusive":"1"}}},"Mission":"mission2.json","altPolicy1.json":{"collision":"1","travelTime":"137","intrusiveness":{"Value":"10","Event-based Values":{"non-intrusive":"∞","very-intrusive":"∞","somewhat-intrusive":"∞"}}},"Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission2\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission2\/altPolicy2.json"],"altPolicy2.json":{"collision":"1.4","travelTime":"127","intrusiveness":{"Value":"13","Event-based Values":{"non-intrusive":"8","very-intrusive":"4","somewhat-intrusive":"1"}}}}
