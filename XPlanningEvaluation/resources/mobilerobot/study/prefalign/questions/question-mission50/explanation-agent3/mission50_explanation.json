{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission50\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission50\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.5999999999999999 collisions (0.32 in cost); take 133.0352840001666 minutes (1.3491743176934956 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 0.0 step, very-intrusive 2.0 steps, and non-intrusive 10.0 steps (0.8 in cost).\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission50\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 1.4 collisions (-0.040000000000000036 in cost), and reduce the intrusiveness to somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps, very-intrusive 1.0 step, and non-intrusive 12.0 steps (-0.13333333333333341 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 152.86788624035 minutes (+0.2011318861502367 in cost). The decrease in collision, and the decrease in intrusiveness are not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission50\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 1.2000000000006106 collisions (-0.07999999999987789 in cost), and reduce the time to 128.58891077431252 minutes (-0.04509279330132321 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to somewhat-intrusive 5.0 steps, very-intrusive 1.0 step, and non-intrusive 6.0 steps (+0.2666666666670201 in cost). The decrease in collision, and the decrease in time are not worth the increase in intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission50\/altPolicy3.json] would reduce the collision to 1.3999999999993769 collisions (-0.0400000000001246 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 138.8230493312443 minutes (+0.058696490936322565 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission50.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission50\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission50\/altPolicy2.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission50\/altPolicy3.json"]}
