{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission41\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission41\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to take 171 minutes; have 0.8 collision; and have intrusiveness-penalty of 5: be non-intrusive 12 steps, somewhat-intrusive 2 steps, and very-intrusive 1 step. It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission41\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.6 collision. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the travel time to 180 minutes. The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in travel time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission41\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the travel time to 167 minutes. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 1 collision. The decrease in travel time is not worth the increase in collision.","solnPolicy.json":{"collision":"0.8","travelTime":"171","intrusiveness":{"non-intrusive":"12","very-intrusive":"1","somewhat-intrusive":"2"}},"Mission":"mission41.json","altPolicy1.json":{"collision":"0.6","travelTime":"180","intrusiveness":{"non-intrusive":"12","very-intrusive":"1","somewhat-intrusive":"2"}},"Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission41\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission41\/altPolicy2.json"],"altPolicy2.json":{"collision":"1","travelTime":"167","intrusiveness":{"non-intrusive":"12","very-intrusive":"1","somewhat-intrusive":"2"}}}
