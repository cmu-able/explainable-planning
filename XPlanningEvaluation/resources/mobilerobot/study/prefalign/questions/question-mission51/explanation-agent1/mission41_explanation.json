{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission41\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission41\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.8 collision (0.264 in cost); take 170.7830515205403 minutes (1.4288937683784202 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps, very-intrusive 1.0 step, and non-intrusive 12.0 steps (0.5499999999999999 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission41\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.5999999999975583 collision (-0.06600000000080578 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 179.60153891497134 minutes (+0.07378180429637449 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission41\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the time to 168.94070963236 minutes (-0.015414356517261307 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 1.0 collision (+0.066 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission41.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission41\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission41\/altPolicy2.json"]}
