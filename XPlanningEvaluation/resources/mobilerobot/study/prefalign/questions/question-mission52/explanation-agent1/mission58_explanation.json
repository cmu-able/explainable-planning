{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission58\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission58\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0 collision; take 174 minutes; and have intrusiveness-penalty of 8: be non-intrusive 6 steps, somewhat-intrusive 5 steps, and very-intrusive 1 step. It has the lowest expected intrusiveness, and collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission58\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 167 minutes. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.2 collision. The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","solnPolicy.json":{"collision":"0","travelTime":"174","intrusiveness":{"non-intrusive":"6","very-intrusive":"1","somewhat-intrusive":"5"}},"Mission":"mission58.json","altPolicy1.json":{"collision":"0.2","travelTime":"167","intrusiveness":{"non-intrusive":"6","very-intrusive":"1","somewhat-intrusive":"5"}},"Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission58\/altPolicy1.json"]}
