{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission56\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission56\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.6 collision (0.12 in cost); take 138.8625899807392 minutes (0.6731591823310811 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 5.0 steps, very-intrusive 1.0 step, and non-intrusive 6.0 steps (1.5999999999999999 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission56\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.39999999999898284 collision (-0.04000000000020343 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 148.3334787040204 minutes (+0.04591168658021527 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission56\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the time to 136.2060787546876 minutes (-0.012877873911398718 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.7999999999991547 collision (+0.03999999999983095 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission56.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission56\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission56\/altPolicy2.json"]}
