{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission61\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission61\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to take 139 minutes; have 0.6 collision; and have intrusiveness-penalty of 8: be non-intrusive 6 steps, somewhat-intrusive 5 steps, and very-intrusive 1 step. It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission61\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the travel time to 136 minutes. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.8 collision. The decrease in travel time is not worth the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission61\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 0.4 collision. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the travel time to 148 minutes. The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in travel time.","solnPolicy.json":{"collision":"0.6","travelTime":"139","intrusiveness":{"non-intrusive":"6","very-intrusive":"1","somewhat-intrusive":"5"}},"Mission":"mission61.json","altPolicy1.json":{"collision":"0.8","travelTime":"136","intrusiveness":{"non-intrusive":"6","very-intrusive":"1","somewhat-intrusive":"5"}},"Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission61\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission61\/altPolicy2.json"],"altPolicy2.json":{"collision":"0.4","travelTime":"148","intrusiveness":{"non-intrusive":"6","very-intrusive":"1","somewhat-intrusive":"5"}}}
