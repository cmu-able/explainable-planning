  <p>I'm planning to follow this policy (see Figure 1). It is expected to take 131 minutes; have 1.2 collisions; and have intrusiveness-penalty of 10: it will be non-intrusive at 8 locations (0-penalty), somewhat-intrusive at 1 location (1-penalty), and very-intrusive at 3 locations (9-penalty). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.</p>

  <p>Alternatively, following this policy (see Figure 2) would reduce the travel time to 127 minutes. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to 13: non-intrusive at 8 locations (0-penalty), somewhat-intrusive at 1 location (1-penalty), and very-intrusive at 4 locations (12-penalty), and increase the collision to 1.4 collisions. The decrease in travel time is not worth the increase in intrusiveness, and the increase in collision.</p>
