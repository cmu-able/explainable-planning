{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission57\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission57\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to take 126 seconds; have 1 expected collision; and have intrusiveness-penalty of 6: it will be non-intrusive at 10 locations (0-penalty), somewhat-intrusive at 0 location (0-penalty), and very-intrusive at 2 locations (6-penalty).\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission57\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the expected collision by 0.2, and reduce the expected intrusiveness by 1: it would be non-intrusive at 12 locations (0-penalty), somewhat-intrusive at 2 locations (2-penalty), and very-intrusive at 1 location (3-penalty). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the expected travel time by 22 seconds. The decrease in expected collision, and the decrease in expected intrusiveness are not worth the increase in expected travel time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission57\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the expected collision by 0.2. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the expected travel time by 8 seconds. The decrease in expected collision is not worth the increase in expected travel time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission57\/altPolicy3.json] would reduce the expected travel time by 5 seconds. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the expected collision by 0.2. The decrease in expected travel time is not worth the increase in expected collision.","solnPolicy.json":{"collision":"1","travelTime":"126","intrusiveness":{"Value":"6","Event-based Values":{"non-intrusive":"10","very-intrusive":"2","somewhat-intrusive":"0"}}},"Mission":"mission57.json","altPolicy1.json":{"collision":"0.8","travelTime":"149","intrusiveness":{"Value":"5","Event-based Values":{"non-intrusive":"12","very-intrusive":"1","somewhat-intrusive":"2"}}},"altPolicy3.json":{"collision":"1.2","travelTime":"121","intrusiveness":{"Value":"6","Event-based Values":{"non-intrusive":"10","very-intrusive":"2","somewhat-intrusive":"0"}}},"Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission57\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission57\/altPolicy2.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission57\/altPolicy3.json"],"altPolicy2.json":{"collision":"0.8","travelTime":"134","intrusiveness":{"Value":"6","Event-based Values":{"non-intrusive":"10","very-intrusive":"2","somewhat-intrusive":"0"}}}}
