{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission9\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission9\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to take 166 seconds; have 0 expected collision; and have intrusiveness-penalty of 10: it will be non-intrusive at 8 locations (0-penalty), somewhat-intrusive at 1 location (1-penalty), and very-intrusive at 3 locations (9-penalty). It has the lowest expected collision, and intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission9\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the expected travel time by 6 seconds. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the expected intrusiveness by 2: it would be non-intrusive at 7 locations (0-penalty), somewhat-intrusive at 3 locations (3-penalty), and very-intrusive at 3 locations (9-penalty). The decrease in expected travel time is not worth the increase in expected intrusiveness.","solnPolicy.json":{"collision":"0","travelTime":"166","intrusiveness":{"Value":"10","Event-based Values":{"non-intrusive":"8","very-intrusive":"3","somewhat-intrusive":"1"}}},"Mission":"mission9.json","altPolicy1.json":{"collision":"0","travelTime":"160","intrusiveness":{"Value":"12","Event-based Values":{"non-intrusive":"7","very-intrusive":"3","somewhat-intrusive":"3"}}},"Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission9\/altPolicy1.json"]}
