{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission8\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission8\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to take 193 minutes; have 0 collision; and have intrusiveness-penalty of 10: be non-intrusive 8 steps, somewhat-intrusive 1 step, and very-intrusive 3 steps. It has the lowest expected intrusiveness, and collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission8\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the travel time to 190 minutes. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.2 collision. The decrease in travel time is not worth the increase in collision.","solnPolicy.json":{"collision":"0","travelTime":"193","intrusiveness":{"non-intrusive":"8","very-intrusive":"3","somewhat-intrusive":"1"}},"Mission":"mission8.json","altPolicy1.json":{"collision":"0.2","travelTime":"190","intrusiveness":{"non-intrusive":"8","very-intrusive":"3","somewhat-intrusive":"1"}},"Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission8\/altPolicy1.json"]}
