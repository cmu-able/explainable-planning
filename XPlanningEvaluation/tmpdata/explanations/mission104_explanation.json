{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission104\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission104\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.4000000000000001 collision (0.12000000000000002 in cost); take 129.8293949081061 minutes (0.7653932338182454 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 4.0 steps, very-intrusive 2.0 steps, and non-intrusive 7.0 steps (1.6666666666666672 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission104\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.3599999999986221 collision (-0.012000000000413402 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 132.59861907713938 minutes (+0.01632562058387632 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission104\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the time to 125.09974920763682 minutes (-0.027883044668420842 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.552 collision (+0.045599999999999974 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission104.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission104\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission104\/altPolicy2.json"]}
