{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission133\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission133\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.4000000000000001 collision (0.16000000000000003 in cost); take 129.8293949081061 minutes (0.7653932338182454 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 4.0 steps, very-intrusive 2.0 steps, and non-intrusive 7.0 steps (1.333333333333334 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission133\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 125.09974920759156 minutes (-0.02788304466868774 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.5519999999997878 collision (+0.06079999999991509 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission133\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 0.35999999999869603 collision (-0.016000000000521625 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 132.59861907715506 minutes (+0.016325620583969025 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission133.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission133\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission133\/altPolicy2.json"]}
