{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission153\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission153\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.2 collisions (0.12 in cost); take 125.58897208709814 minutes (0.7326023371747393 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 6.000000000000001 steps, very-intrusive 0.0 step, and non-intrusive 7.0 steps (1.3999999999999997 in cost). It has the lowest expected time, and intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission153\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 1.1599999999979371 collisions (-0.004000000000206283 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 127.0047251566564 minutes (+0.008258559572423163 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission153.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission153\/altPolicy1.json"]}
