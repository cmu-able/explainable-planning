{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission158\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission158\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.0 collision (0.0 in cost); take 166.69770046132672 minutes (1.4229233449223744 in cost); and be non-intrusive 4.0 steps, very-intrusive 3.0000000000000004 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 6.000000000000001 steps (0.5 in cost). It has the lowest expected collision, and intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission158\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 163.97200632127326 minutes (-0.023266390671657033 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.03999999999995413 collision (+0.023999999999972477 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission158.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission158\/altPolicy1.json"]}
