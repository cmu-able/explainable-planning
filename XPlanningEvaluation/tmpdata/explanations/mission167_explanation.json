{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission167\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission167\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.0 collision (0.3 in cost); take 138.57716744061383 minutes (2.04241162788708 in cost); and be non-intrusive 7.0 steps, very-intrusive 5.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps (1.1333333333333333 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission167\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.9599999999999941 collision (-0.012000000000001787 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 140.47134518537914 minutes (+0.027917229963958512 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission167\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 0.8799999999992427 collision (-0.036000000000227184 in cost), and reduce the time to 137.0841338665211 minutes (-0.022004989630484584 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to non-intrusive 6.2 steps, very-intrusive 5.4 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps (+0.079999999999117 in cost). The decrease in collision, and the decrease in time are not worth the increase in intrusiveness.","Mission":"mission167.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission167\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission167\/altPolicy2.json"]}
