{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission171\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission171\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.0 collision (0.0 in cost); take 176.83305551422237 minutes (0.5157630785831486 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 6.000000000000001 steps, very-intrusive 0.0 step, and non-intrusive 7.0 steps (1.3999999999999997 in cost). It has the lowest expected collision, and intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission171\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 175.06472495908014 minutes (-0.005157630785831424 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.04000000000000001 collision (+0.008000000000000002 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission171.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission171\/altPolicy1.json"]}
