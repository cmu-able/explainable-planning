{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission174\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission174\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.0 collision (0.0 in cost); take 176.83305551422237 minutes (1.5472892357494459 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 6.000000000000001 steps, very-intrusive 0.0 step, and non-intrusive 7.0 steps (0.19999999999999996 in cost). It has the lowest expected collision, and intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission174\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 175.06472495908017 minutes (-0.015472892357494494 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.04000000000000001 collision (+0.024000000000000004 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission174.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission174\/altPolicy1.json"]}
