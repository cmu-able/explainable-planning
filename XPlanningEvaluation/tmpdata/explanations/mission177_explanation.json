{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission177\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission177\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.6000000000000001 collision (0.18000000000000002 in cost); take 149.82557845755505 minutes (1.3249174127956747 in cost); and be non-intrusive 7.0 steps, very-intrusive 5.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps (2.2666666666666666 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission177\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 148.13235748036303 minutes (-0.014973264108091522 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.7599999999993965 collision (+0.04799999999981891 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission177\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 0.5599999999984561 collision (-0.012000000000463196 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 151.71975620210338 minutes (+0.01675033797645642 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission177.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission177\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission177\/altPolicy2.json"]}
