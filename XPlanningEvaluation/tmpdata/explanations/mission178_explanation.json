{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission178\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission178\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.4 collision (0.2 in cost); take 144.84891678751345 minutes (1.7078779565064843 in cost); and be non-intrusive 5.0 steps, very-intrusive 6.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps (0.6666666666666666 in cost).\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission178\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 142.885696479558 minutes (-0.023147847854751546 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.52 collision (+0.06 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission178\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 0.3599999999999999 collision (-0.020000000000000073 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 146.74309453233067 minutes (+0.022333783971778987 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission178\/altPolicy3.json] would reduce the collision to 0.319999999998399 collision (-0.040000000000800506 in cost), and reduce the intrusiveness to non-intrusive 5.800000000000001 steps, very-intrusive 5.6 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps (-0.04000000000115411 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 152.73549251271092 minutes (+0.09298867490422968 in cost). The decrease in collision, and the decrease in intrusiveness are not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission178.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission178\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission178\/altPolicy2.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission178\/altPolicy3.json"]}
