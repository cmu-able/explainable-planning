{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission25\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission25\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.4 collisions (0.13999999999999999 in cost); take 131.34246077690926 minutes (0.7743133276007277 in cost); and be non-intrusive 7.0 steps, very-intrusive 5.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps (3.966666666666666 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission25\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 1.2799999999991958 collisions (-0.01200000000008039 in cost), and reduce the time to 129.84942720289607 minutes (-0.008801995851725586 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to non-intrusive 6.2 steps, very-intrusive 5.4 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps (+0.27999999999836067 in cost). The decrease in collision, and the decrease in time are not worth the increase in intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission25\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 1.35999999999735 collisions (-0.004000000000264986 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 133.23663852141541 minutes (+0.011166891984055405 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission25.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission25\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission25\/altPolicy2.json"]}
