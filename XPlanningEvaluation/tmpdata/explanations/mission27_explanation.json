{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission27\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission27\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.2 collision (0.06 in cost); take 184.77381561806484 minutes (1.0893113101308673 in cost); and be non-intrusive 8.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps, and very-intrusive 3.0000000000000004 steps (1.8333333333333337 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission27\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.16000000000000003 collision (-0.01199999999999999 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 187.55045569078004 minutes (+0.016369340132171617 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission27\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the time to 182.83914705543998 minutes (-0.011405600623511036 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.24 collision (+0.011999999999999997 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission27.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission27\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission27\/altPolicy2.json"]}
