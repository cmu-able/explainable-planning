{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission2\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission2\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.0 collision (0.3 in cost); take 123.38347157236265 minutes (2.1063904492025247 in cost); and be non-intrusive 4.0 steps, very-intrusive 3.0000000000000004 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 6.000000000000001 steps (0.5 in cost). It has the lowest expected time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission2\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the intrusiveness to non-intrusive Infinity steps, very-intrusive Infinity steps, and somewhat-intrusive Infinity steps (-0.016666666666666607 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 134.0018651285542 minutes (+0.18127616679611647 in cost), and increase the collision to 1.0750000000000002 collisions (+0.022500000000000075 in cost). The decrease in intrusiveness is not worth the increase in time, and the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission2\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 0.9200000000000002 collision (-0.023999999999999966 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 125.80180727581 minutes (+0.04128558844868824 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission2.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission2\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission2\/altPolicy2.json"]}
