{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission42\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission42\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.4 collisions (0.27999999999999997 in cost); take 131.34246077690926 minutes (2.3229399828021826 in cost); and be non-intrusive 7.0 steps, very-intrusive 5.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps (1.1333333333333333 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission42\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 1.3200000000000003 collisions (-0.015999999999999903 in cost), and reduce the time to 127.955249458302 minutes (-0.059906663508897395 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to non-intrusive 6.2 steps, very-intrusive 5.4 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps (+0.0800000000000003 in cost). The decrease in collision, and the decrease in time are not worth the increase in intrusiveness.","Mission":"mission42.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission42\/altPolicy1.json"]}
