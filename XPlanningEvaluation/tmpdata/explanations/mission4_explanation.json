{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission4\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission4\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.2 collisions (0.12 in cost); take 125.58897208709814 minutes (1.8315058429368483 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 6.000000000000001 steps, very-intrusive 0.0 step, and non-intrusive 7.0 steps (0.7999999999999998 in cost). It has the lowest expected time, and intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission4\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 1.1600000000000001 collisions (-0.003999999999999976 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 127.00472515680603 minutes (+0.020646398933240606 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission4.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission4\/altPolicy1.json"]}
