{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission63\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission63\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.0 collision (0.0 in cost); take 178.47063473081673 minutes (1.5782275233767464 in cost); and be non-intrusive 8.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 3.0 steps, and very-intrusive 3.0 steps (0.8 in cost). It has the lowest expected collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission63\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the intrusiveness to non-intrusive 8.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps, and very-intrusive 3.0000000000000004 steps (-0.06666666667659615 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 195.28912994016218 minutes (+0.14872705574899725 in cost). The decrease in intrusiveness is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission63\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the time to 168.486054994915 minutes (-0.0882942931890005 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.19999999999914647 collision (+0.09999999999957324 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission63.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission63\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission63\/altPolicy2.json"]}
