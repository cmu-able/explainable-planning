{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission65\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission65\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.0 collision (0.1 in cost); take 151.1562073943625 minutes (0.44556141723975984 in cost); and be non-intrusive 8.0 steps, somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps, and very-intrusive 3.0000000000000004 steps (2.933333333333334 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission65\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 149.51021896762512 minutes (-0.004851861189292539 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 1.1999999999989523 collisions (+0.01999999999989524 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission65\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 0.9600000000000003 collision (-0.003999999999999976 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 153.09087595718006 minutes (+0.005702800312323508 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission65.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission65\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission65\/altPolicy2.json"]}
