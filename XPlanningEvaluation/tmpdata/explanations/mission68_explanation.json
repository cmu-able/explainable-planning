{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission68\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission68\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.4000000000000001 collisions (0.14 in cost); take 135.97878163947533 minutes (1.5476108930392813 in cost); and be non-intrusive 6.0 steps, very-intrusive 2.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 6.000000000000001 steps (2.0 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission68\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 134.4845175135322 minutes (-0.017006619786597454 in cost), and reduce the collision to 1.0799999999998082 collisions (-0.03200000000001918 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the intrusiveness to non-intrusive 4.800000000000001 steps, very-intrusive 2.8000000000000003 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 6.000000000000001 steps (+0.4000000000016586 in cost). The decrease in time, and the decrease in collision are not worth the increase in intrusiveness.","Mission":"mission68.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission68\/altPolicy1.json"]}
