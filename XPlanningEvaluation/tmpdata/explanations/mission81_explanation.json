{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission81\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission81\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.0 collision (0.1 in cost); take 147.22719265641655 minutes (0.4189080170441038 in cost); and be non-intrusive 6.0 steps, very-intrusive 2.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 6.000000000000001 steps (3.2 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission81\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 0.9600000000000001 collision (-0.00399999999999999 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 149.80659359837003 minutes (+0.007339213050656046 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission81\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the time to 145.2391333666777 minutes (-0.005656658663417746 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 1.1119999999996195 collisions (+0.011199999999961949 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.","Mission":"mission81.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission81\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission81\/altPolicy2.json"]}
