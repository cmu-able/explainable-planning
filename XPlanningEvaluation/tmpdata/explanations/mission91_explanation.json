{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission91\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission91\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 1.2000000000000002 collisions (0.24000000000000005 in cost); take 122.8744324800781 minutes (2.535368878028469 in cost); and be non-intrusive 5.0 steps, very-intrusive 6.0 steps, and somewhat-intrusive 2.0 steps (0.6666666666666666 in cost). It has the lowest expected time, and intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission91\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the collision to 1.159999999997388 collisions (-0.008000000000522423 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 124.76861022454318 minutes (+0.03908412194334687 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission91.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission91\/altPolicy1.json"]}
