{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission99\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission99\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.2 collision (0.06 in cost); take 166.31774119070525 minutes (0.9701868236124472 in cost); and be somewhat-intrusive 6.000000000000001 steps, very-intrusive 0.0 step, and non-intrusive 7.0 steps (0.9999999999999998 in cost). It has the lowest expected intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission99\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the time to 164.3830726274989 minutes (-0.011285566618703169 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the collision to 0.2399999999996529 collision (+0.011999999999895872 in cost). The decrease in time is not worth the increase in collision.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission99\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the collision to 0.15999999999993708 collision (-0.012000000000018878 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the time to 169.09438126296905 minutes (+0.016197067088205785 in cost). The decrease in collision is not worth the increase in time.","Mission":"mission99.json","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission99\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission99\/altPolicy2.json"]}
